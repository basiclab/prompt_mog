  "prompt": "From the lofty perspective of a high-flying drone, a secluded coastal village emerges, cradled between the azure expanse of the ocean and the lush green of rolling hills. The village is dotted with quaint little houses, their red-tiled roofs forming a vibrant mosaic against the backdrop of verdant trees swaying gently in the breeze. The camera angle is slightly tilted, capturing the curvature of the shoreline as it arcs gracefully away into the distance, its sandy beaches kissed by the gentle lap of turquoise waves. In the foreground, a lone fishing boat is anchored, its shadow stretching long over the shimmering water, while seagulls circle lazily above, their wings catching the sunlight in a dazzling display of soft white feathers. A brilliant midday sun casts its light with an intensity that highlights every detail, from the rough texture of the cliffs that frame the village to the delicate patterns of ripples on the water's surface. Shadows cut sharply across the landscape, adding depth and contrast to the scene. The overall color palette harmonizes warm earth tones with the cool blues of the sea and sky, evoking a serene and timeless coastal charm. Flowers in soft pastel shades bloom sporadically along the cliff edges, adding splashes of color against the rugged terrain. The composition showcases a masterful blend of natural beauty and human settlement, captured in vivid detail and clarity, reminiscent of a National Geographic feature, with impeccable sharpness and dynamic depth that invites the viewer to linger over each element of this tranquil coastal tableau.",
