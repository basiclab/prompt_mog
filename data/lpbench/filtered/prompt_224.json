  "theme": "Weather Photography",
  "prompt": "Under a roiling, tempestuous sky, a solitary lighthouse stands steadfast on a rugged coastal cliff, its weathered stones telling tales of countless storms endured. The scene captures the lighthouse from a slightly elevated angle, emphasizing its stalwart silhouette against the towering curtain of storm clouds that dominate the background. A distant crack of lightning illuminates the scene with a flickering blue-white brilliance, momentarily highlighting the intricate patterns of the storm-tossed ocean waves crashing relentlessly against the rocks below. The light of the approaching evening casts a dramatic chiaroscuro across the scene, with deep shadows pooling in the crevices of the cliff and a muted twilight glow suffusing the atmosphere with a somber, anticipative mood. The color palette is a study in contrasts: the dark, moody grays and blues of the storm clouds juxtapose with the warm, ochre tones of the lighthouse and the cold, churning sea. This composition paints a raw, visceral picture of nature's fury, reminiscent of classical seascapes, yet captured with the precision and clarity of modern high-resolution photography. The overall impression is one of awe and reverence for the power of the elements, enhanced by immaculate detail and a cinematic, sweeping panorama that captures the vastness and drama of the approaching storm. The texture of the scene is palpable, with every detail, from the rough-hewn stones of the lighthouse to the frothy spume of the waves, rendered in sharp relief against the brooding backdrop.",
