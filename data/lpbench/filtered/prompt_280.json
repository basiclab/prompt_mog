  "prompt": "In an isolated coastal setting, a solitary, weathered lighthouse stands defiantly against the relentless embrace of the sea. Built of aged stone, the lighthouse is a testament to enduring human ingenuity and resilience. Perched on a rocky outcrop, it overlooks the churning waters of the Atlantic Ocean, where waves crash incessantly against the jagged cliffs below. This scene is captured from a low-angle perspective, emphasizing the lighthouse's towering presence against the expansive sky. The composition draws the viewer's eye from the rugged foreground of sharp rocks and white sea foam, through the midground dominated by the steadfast lighthouse, and into the soft horizon where sky meets ocean. The afternoon sun casts a warm, golden light, softening the harshness of the stone structure and creating elongated shadows that stretch across the undulating terrain. Thin veils of mist rise from the ocean, adding a dreamlike quality to the air and blurring the boundaries between sea and sky. The color palette is anchored by the earthy tones of the lighthouse, complemented by the cool blues and greens of the restless sea, and a richly textured sky awash in shades of coral and lavender, suggesting an impending sunset. The mood is one of solitude and timelessness, evoking a deep sense of peace and contemplation. The photograph employs a documentary aesthetic, offering a composition that is both artistic and naturalistic, with a focus on capturing the raw essence of the scene. The image is rendered in sharp, 8K resolution, ensuring every detail of the lighthouse's weathered stone and the tumultuous sea is captured with exceptional clarity and depth, worthy of a professional photography exhibition.",
