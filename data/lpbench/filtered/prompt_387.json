  "prompt": "Nestled in an upscale suburban neighborhood, a pristine two-story villa stands as the epitome of modern luxury and architectural brilliance. The facade, adorned with sleek lines and expansive glass windows, reflects its carefully landscaped garden, complete with flowering shrubs and a tranquil koi pond. The scene is captured from an elevated angle, positioned slightly to the right, allowing the entire frontage of the house to be in view, while emphasizing the lush greenery surrounding it. A cobblestone driveway leads the eye towards the main entrance, flanked by twin marble columns that add to the grandeur of the structure. In the backdrop, the silhouette of rolling hills can be seen, grounding the property in its natural environment. Bathed in the soft glow of late afternoon light, the villa's exterior gleams with a warm beige tone, while long shadows cast by the setting sun create a dynamic interplay of light and shade. This golden hour illumination enhances the richness of the house's color palette, blending warm earth tones with the cool blues of the evening sky. The mood is both serene and inviting, drawing potential buyers into a vision of refined comfort and elegance. The photograph captures this moment with professional precision, showcasing every detail from the texture of the stone walkway to the reflections in the window glass, all rendered in crystal-clear 8K resolution. This image embodies the high-end elegance of fine art photography, perfected by the use of state-of-the-art camera techniques that elevate the property to an aspirational status.",
