  "prompt": "At the forefront of this dramatic composition stands an ancient, weather-beaten barn perched precariously on the edge of a stark, barren field. The sky above is a tumultuous canvas of dark swirling clouds interspersed with bright flashes of jagged lightning, illuminating the scene in sporadic bursts. Captured from a slightly elevated angle to the right, the barn looms large, its wooden structure creaking under the oncoming storm’s pressure, contrasting sharply with the vastness of the open land that stretches outwards, seemingly endless. The fading light of dusk casts long, eerie shadows from the barn across the sparse, rain-drenched earth, as the first heavy drops begin to fall, creating ripples in isolated puddles scattered across the foreground. This interplay of light and shadow enhances the ominous atmosphere, with the western horizon still faintly aglow in burnt oranges and purples, a fleeting remnant of the sun’s departure. The mood is somber yet electrifying, encapsulating a moment where nature’s fury and beauty culminate in an awe-inspiring display. The scene is rendered with high-definition precision, every raindrop and splinter of wood brought to vivid clarity, showcasing a masterpiece of professional weather photography that captures the raw, untamed essence of the storm.",
