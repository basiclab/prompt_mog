  "prompt": "In the heart of the countryside, a dramatic weather spectacle unfolds as a massive thunderstorm approaches a sprawling, sunlit wheat field. The horizon is dominated by a towering cumulonimbus cloud, its dark, swirling mass looming ominously overhead, yet the golden wheat field below remains vividly illuminated by the late afternoon sun, creating a stark contrast between light and shadow. A solitary red barn stands resilient at the edge of the field, its rustic charm juxtaposed against the theater of the skies. This scene is captured from a low vantage point, looking upward towards the cloud mass, which fills two-thirds of the frame, conveying the immense scale of the approaching storm. In the foreground, the wheat sways gently, kissed by the warm glow of sunlight, which highlights the vivid colors and textures of each stalk. Shadows lengthen across the field, hinting at the impending shift in weather. The scene is rich with the dynamic interplay of colors: the golden hues of the wheat field contrasted against the deep grays and blues of the storm clouds. As the storm advances, bursts of forked lightning occasionally illuminate the underbellies of the clouds, adding a dramatic flair to the unfolding scene. The air is thick with anticipation, a blend of tranquility and tumult, evoking a sense of awe at nature's caprices. The photograph captures an atmospheric quality, with sharp focus on the barn and field, while the clouds above blur into a softer focus, suggesting movement and fluidity. The image, reminiscent of classic landscape photography, employs a highly detailed, high-resolution style, emphasizing textures and capturing the vibrant contrasts in lighting and color to create a visually compelling narrative.",
