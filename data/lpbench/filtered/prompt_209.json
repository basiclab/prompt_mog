  "prompt": "Under the brooding expanse of the sky, a quaint coastal village braces for an impending storm. The air is thick with anticipation as enormous, swirling nimbus clouds begin to gather, casting deep, shifting shadows over the landscape. A weathered lighthouse stands proudly at the edge of a jagged cliff, its stark silhouette a beacon against the tumultuous backdrop. The scene is observed from a slightly elevated angle, capturing the layered composition of the village nestled against rugged cliffs to the right, a roiling sea stretching out beyond, and the foreboding sky above. In the foreground, tattered flags on fishing boats flap wildly in the strengthening winds, hinting at the chaotic energy soon to descend. The midground centers on the lighthouse, its structure highlighted by intermittent flashes of distant lightning, which illuminate the scene in a stark, ethereal light. The deepening storm clouds create a palette dominated by ominous grays and deep blues, contrasted by brief, luminous flares of lightning and the warm glow of the lighthouse's rotating beam. Shadows stretch and contort as the inconsistent lighting flickers across the terrain, adding to the scene's ominous yet captivating mood. The atmosphere is thick with the scent of rain and sea salt, creating a tangible tension that grips the viewer. This dramatic coastal tableau is presented in a classic, high-contrast black-and-white style reminiscent of fine art photography. The image is sharp and meticulously detailed, with each element rendered in crisp focus to underline the gravity and beauty of nature's theatrical display. An 8K resolution ensures that every nuance of texture and light is brought to life, marking the piece as a masterful example of professional weather photography.",
