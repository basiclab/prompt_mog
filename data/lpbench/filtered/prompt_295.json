  "prompt": "Nestled within a picturesque city square, an ornate baroque-style palace stands majestically, its architectural details speaking to the opulence of a forgotten era. The main facade is a testament to intricate craftsmanship, adorned with sweeping arches, elaborate stone carvings, and gilded embellishments that catch the first light of dawn, casting an ethereal glow over the cityscape. From a slightly elevated vantage point, the scene captures the grandeur of the palace, framed by towering cypress trees that flank its sides, their dark foliage providing a striking contrast to the palace's limestone façade shimmering with hues of soft gold and ivory. The camera perspective is wide, encompassing the palace in its entirety, allowing viewers to appreciate both the scale and the fineness of its details. In the foreground, cobblestone pathways lead toward the grand entrance, where a series of marble steps ascend to intricately carved wooden doors, inviting the viewer to imagine the historical gatherings once held within. The morning atmosphere is serene, the air crisp with a gentle mist that lingers near the ground, softening the light and creating a surreal atmosphere. The interplay of light and shadow emphasizes the depth and texture of the palace's exterior, while the clear sky transitions from a pale lavender to a deeper blue, enhancing the visual harmony with the building's warm color palette. The photo is captured in the style of classical architectural photography, focusing on clarity and detail, with a composition that highlights the symmetry and balance of the design. The final image is a masterful representation of architectural elegance, characterized by sharp focus, meticulous attention to detail, and vibrant color reproduction, evoking a sense of timeless sophistication and awe.",
