  "prompt": "Nestled within a tranquil coastal village lies a stunning example of modern architectural brilliance, a house designed to harmonize with the natural landscape. The structure features expansive glass walls that offer a seamless transition between the interior space and the surrounding environment, capturing breathtaking views of the ocean's horizon. Positioned on a gentle slope, the house opens to a spacious wooden deck on the front, which serves as a perfect vantage point for observing the rolling waves and distant sailboats. Inside, the open-plan living area flows effortlessly through various zones, with sleek, minimalist furnishings that complement the home's clean lines and airy feel. The perspective is captured from an elevated angle, showcasing not only the house itself but also the interplay between the built and natural elements. In the foreground, native grasses and coastal flora gently sway in the breeze, while the midground features the house prominently framed by tall palm trees. The background is dominated by the endless expanse of the sea, connecting the earth and sky. Bathed in the soft, golden light of the late afternoon sun, the scene radiates warmth and serenity, with the long shadows adding depth and drama. The color palette is a sophisticated blend of earthy tones and oceanic hues, with the deep blues and greens of the sea enhancing the light wooden textures of the house's facade. The visual narrative captures a sense of quiet elegance and modern luxury balanced with the simplicity of nature. Photographed in the style of fine art architecture photography, the image boasts exquisite detail and clarity, presenting an award-winning composition that celebrates the seamless integration of human ingenuity and natural beauty.",
