  "prompt": "In the heart of a bustling urban environment, an exquisite three-story brownstone townhouse presents a harmonious blend of historical charm and modern luxury. Situated at the end of a picturesque, tree-lined street, its brick façade is highlighted by elegant wrought-iron railings and large bay windows. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated, frontal perspective, allowing the viewer to appreciate the symmetrical architectural design and the welcoming stoop adorned with seasonal potted plants. As the morning sun rises over the city, soft golden light washes over the building, accentuating the deep reds of the brickwork and the warm tones of the wooden front door. The gentle illumination casts delicate shadows across the sidewalk, enhancing the intricate details of the wrought-iron railings and window sills. Complementing the scene's inviting atmosphere, the color palette embraces a blend of deep umber, soft creams, and verdant greens from the surrounding foliage. Inside, through the slightly open front door, glimpses of a sophisticated interior are visible, featuring polished wooden floors and a plush living area. This image is crafted in the style of professional real estate photography, emphasizing clarity and detail to showcase the property's character and charm. Every detail, from the crisp lines of the architecture to the vibrant hues of the potted plants, is captured in high resolution, ensuring that the photograph conveys an unmatched sense of place and style.",
