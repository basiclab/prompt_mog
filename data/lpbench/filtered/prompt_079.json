  "prompt": "As the tide begins its gentle retreat, a sweeping expanse of coastal beauty unfurls beneath the soft embrace of twilight. A rugged cliffside, weathered by countless years of oceanic caresses, dominates the left foreground, its jagged edges bathed in the cool and fading light of dusk. Perched above rests an ancient lighthouse, its white facade streaked with the patina of time, standing resolute against the encroaching night. To the right, the vast ocean unfurls in a rhythmic dance, its surface reflecting the muted hues of a sky transitioning from daylight to night, a blend of soft purples, blues, and burnt orange. A solitary sailboat, its sails catching the last whispers of the evening breeze, glides effortlessly across the water, carving a delicate trail through the shallows. In the immediate foreground, a collection of tide pools brims with life, their still waters capturing reflections of the heavens above, punctuated by small, delicate marine creatures exploring their liquid realm. The camera captures this tranquil scene from an elevated vantage point, allowing the elements to stretch gracefully across the frame, leading the viewer’s eye from the sturdy lighthouse through the winding rocky outcrops to the infinite horizon where sea meets sky. The atmosphere is suffused with a gentle mist that softens the scene, casting a dreamlike quality over the coastal landscape. The play of light and shadow creates intricate patterns on the surface of the water and rocks, while long, gentle shadows stretch across the beach, mirroring the lengthening shadows in the sky. The color palette is a harmonious blend of cool blues and purples with hints of orange and pink, creating an emotional tone of serenity and reflective calm. This image is captured in the style of classic maritime photography with a focus on natural splendor and technical excellence, offering a breathtakingly detailed and professional portrayal of a timeless seascape, shot in crisp 8K resolution that ensures each ripple and grain of sand is masterfully depicted.",
