  "prompt": "In an isolated coastal landscape, a magnificent modern architectural library stands gracefully overlooking the vast expanse of the ocean. The building is a fusion of organic forms and cutting-edge design, featuring sweeping, undulating lines that mimic the gentle roll of the nearby waves. Large, floor-to-ceiling glass panels wrap around the exterior, offering panoramic views of the endless horizon. The structure is thoughtfully placed on a rocky promontory, with pathways leading up to it meandering through meticulously landscaped gardens filled with native coastal flora. From a slightly elevated angle, the library is framed to capture the interplay between its innovative design and the natural elements, with the horizon peeking through the transparent sections of the facade. The serene atmosphere is enhanced by the early morning light, which diffuses softly through a thin veil of mist, casting gentle reflections across the glass surfaces. This light creates a tranquil ambiance, as the warm tones of dawn blend seamlessly with the cool blues of the ocean and sky. The color palette of the structure itself is a harmonious mix of earthy browns and greens, echoing the surrounding landscape, while the architectural lines add a modern touch. The entire scene evokes a sense of peace and contemplation, inviting visitors to pause and engage with both the built and natural environment. The library's design is captured with professional precision, the details of its construction starkly clear against the soft backdrop of the coastal scenery. Its high-resolution depiction brings out the texture of the materials used, from the smooth glass to the intricate stonework, culminating in an image that is both technically and artistically exceptional.",
