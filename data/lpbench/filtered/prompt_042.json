  "prompt": "As the early morning light slowly creeps across the horizon, a coastal scene brimming with dynamic motion and tranquility unfolds. Dominant in the foreground, a cluster of angular rocks juts defiantly out of sparkling turquoise waters, their rugged surfaces etched with the history of countless tides. These rocks play host to small pools where seaweed undulates with the rhythm of the ocean. Just beyond, the sea stretches out, its gentle waves rolling towards the shore in a mesmerizing dance, while seagulls glide gracefully above, casting fleeting shadows upon the surface. The viewer's perspective is low and angled slightly upwards, enhancing the grandeur of the scene and transforming the viewer into an intimate observer of this natural symphony. The horizon line sits high in the frame, emphasizing the expansive sky above, which is painted with the pastel hues of dawn. The clouds, scattered yet dense, are illuminated with hints of pink and orange, a testament to the sun’s gradual ascent. This morning light casts a soft glow across the scene, rendering the rocks with warm highlights and cool shadows that accentuate their textures. The color palette, dominated by soft blues, greens, and warm earth tones, evokes a sense of calm and renewal. In the midground, a solitary sailboat drifts lazily, its silhouetted sails creating a striking contrast against the colorful sky. The reflection of the clouds on the water adds to the serene atmosphere, adding layers of depth and dimension to the composition. The overall scene captures the silent beauty and strength of nature, a moment frozen in time with the precision of high-resolution photography, ensuring every detail, from the glistening droplets on the rocks to the delicate wings of the seagulls, is rendered with crystal clarity. The composition embraces a documentary photojournalism aesthetic, inviting the viewer to explore the delicate balance of motion and stillness in the coastal landscape.",
