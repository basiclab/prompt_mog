  "prompt": "In the heart of a historic European city, a magnificent Art Nouveau hotel stands proudly, embodying the exuberance and elegance of the early 20th century. The hotel, with its intricate ironwork balconies and lavishly decorated stone facade, seems to breathe life and history into the bustling city square it dominates. The setting is captured from a ground-level perspective, emphasizing the grand scale and ornate details of the building. In the foreground, cobblestone streets curve gracefully around the hotel's base, lined with vibrant flower beds that soften the stone's austerity. The midground showcases large glass windows adorned with stained glass, glinting subtly as they catch the midday sun. In the background, quaint shops and cafes frame the scene, their warm, inviting awnings offering a counterpoint to the hotel's more imposing grandeur. The lighting is a soft, diffused daylight, typical of an overcast day, which bathes the setting in a gentle glow, casting mild shadows that accentuate the architectural details. The clouds are thick, yet they allow occasional sunrays to break through, creating patches of light that dance across the facade, enhancing its three-dimensional carvings. The color palette is a sophisticated mix of earth tones and pastels, with the warm oatmeal hue of the stone harmonizing with the rich greens of the surrounding foliage and the deep, rust-colored ironwork. This palette imparts a serene yet nostalgic mood, reminiscent of a bygone era where craftsmanship reigned supreme. The structure's intricate details are depicted with crisp clarity, capturing the essence of Art Nouveau's sinuous lines and organic motifs. The overall composition employs a documentary photography approach, providing a masterful depiction that combines historical charm with technical precision, ensuring every detail is rendered in stunning 8K resolution and immaculate sharpness.",
