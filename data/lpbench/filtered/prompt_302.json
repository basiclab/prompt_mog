  "prompt": "In the tranquil heart of a bustling port city, an architectural wonder from a bygone era stands as both a guardian and a guide. This iconic structure is a grand neoclassical lighthouse, with its weathered facade softened by layers of time, and its towering form reaching skyward like a sentinel overlooking the sea. The lighthouse is strategically perched at the edge of a rugged cliff, its sturdy base resisting the relentless assault of ocean waves crashing against the rocks below. Viewed from a vantage point near sea level, the image captures the lighthouse in its entirety, framed by the expansive horizon that stretches out infinitely. The composition draws the viewer’s eye along a diagonal line from the rocky foreground, across the vibrant wildflower-dotted cliffside, and culminates at the towering structure bathed in soft, golden morning light. This gentle illumination reveals the intricate details of the lighthouse's stone masonry and the patina of its copper dome, casting delicate, elongated shadows that dance across the facade. The color palette is a harmonious blend of warm earth tones and cool sea blues, enhanced by the soft oranges of the sunrise, creating an atmosphere of serene majesty. The scene is suffused with a sense of timelessness, as if captured in a fine art photograph that conveys not only the technical skill of the practitioner but also the emotional resonance of the place. The photograph is meticulously composed with a sharp focus that emphasizes the textures and details of both the natural surroundings and the architectural structure, creating an immersive experience for the viewer.",
