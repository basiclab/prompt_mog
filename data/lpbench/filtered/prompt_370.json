  "prompt": "In the heart of a bustling coastal city, a newly developed luxury condominium complex stands prominently along the marina, its sleek facade reflecting the iridescent hues of the ocean. The building, with its contemporary architectural design, showcases an array of glass balconies that overlook the sparkling waterfront, offering panoramic views that extend to the distant horizon. Positioned centrally in the frame, the condominium becomes a striking focal point, with its vertical lines drawing the eye upwards towards the intricate rooftop gardens that cascade downwards in a symphony of verdant terraces. Nearby, luxury yachts bob gently in the calm marina waters, their polished exteriors gleaming under the midday sun. The camera's elevated perspective captures the grandeur of the complex from a slightly angled viewpoint, creating a dynamic composition that emphasizes both the height of the structure and its harmonious integration with the surrounding landscape. The scene is bathed in the clear, bright light of a summer afternoon, casting sharp, defined shadows that enhance the vivid contrast between the crisp, azure sky and the pristine white of the building's façade. The overall color palette is dominated by cool blues and whites, underscored by the lush greens of the rooftop gardens and the marina's deep blue waters, conveying a sense of modern elegance and tranquility. This image, rendered with remarkable clarity and precision, epitomizes the fine art real estate photography genre, showcasing every detail with striking sharpness and high resolution. The meticulous composition and expert use of natural lighting result in an image that not only documents the property but also embodies the aspirational lifestyle it represents.",
