  "prompt": "Nestled within a quiet, tree-lined avenue of an affluent suburban neighborhood, a stately Georgian-style mansion commands attention with its symmetrical façade and grand columned entrance. The home is surrounded by meticulously maintained gardens, where a symphony of colors from blooming azaleas and hydrangeas creates a picturesque backdrop. Captured from a slightly elevated perspective, the mansion's grandeur is emphasized, with the camera framing the front in a way that accentuates the elegance of the brickwork and the patterned slate roof. In the foreground, a circular gravel driveway leads up to the entrance, lined with neatly trimmed hedges. Beyond the house, lush landscaping melds naturally with the wooded area that borders the rear of the property, adding a sense of privacy and seclusion. The late afternoon sun bathes the scene in a warm, golden glow, casting long shadows across the lawn and highlighting the intricate details of the wrought iron accents on the windows and doors. The color palette is dominated by the rich red of the bricks, complemented by the crisp white of the columns and window frames, creating a timeless yet inviting atmosphere. The style is that of classic architectural photography, with a focus on symmetry and precision, providing a professional and polished look that captures the home's opulent charm and refined character. The image, with its crisp details and high resolution, ensures that every element, from the texture of the brick to the individual leaves of the shrubbery, is captured with clarity and finesse, underscoring the technical excellence of the photograph.",
