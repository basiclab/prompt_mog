  "prompt": "At the edge of the vast, untamed ocean, an iconic scene unfolds where jagged cliffs meet the relentless sea. The scene is dominated by a solitary lighthouse perched atop the highest cliff, a beacon of guidance and resilience against the backdrop of the sprawling marine expanse. Beyond the cliffs, the ocean stretches out infinitely, its surface a tapestry of shifting patterns where turquoise waves crest and crash against the rocks below, sending up plumes of white spray. The scene is observed from a high vantage point, allowing for a panoramic view that captures both the rugged coast and the endless horizon. The cliffs, weathered by countless storms, are rugged and sheer, their striations visible even from a distance, creating a stark contrast against the fluidity of the ocean. The sky above is a canvas of mottled gray clouds, hinting at an approaching storm yet allowing slits of golden sunlight to pierce through, casting dramatic highlights across the waves. The air is filled with the salty tang of the sea and the distant cries of seagulls, which circle in the gusty breeze. As the light dances across the scene, it imbues the water with a mesmerizing blend of sea greens and deep blues, while the cliffs reflect muted earth tones. The mood is one of majestic solitude and dynamic natural forces, with the lighthouse acting as a silent sentinel, watching over this ever-changing marine landscape. The technical composition showcases a masterful use of natural elements, with sharp, detailed resolution that captures the intricate textures of rock and wave, making it a seascape worthy of a discerning eye and professional acclaim.",
