  "prompt": "In the flourishing gardens of a grandiose Edwardian manor, an elegant wedding reception is underway, seamlessly blending timeless tradition with contemporary flair. Beneath a sprawling marquee draped in silk and adorned with ethereal fairy lights, guests clad in exquisitely tailored evening attire gather around tables adorned with ornate floral centerpieces and fine china. The bride and groom, poised at the center, share a moment of laughter under a cascading chandelier that emanates soft, warm light, enhancing the intimate ambiance of the evening. Captured from a slightly elevated angle, the scene frames the couple in the foreground while offering a sweeping view of the venue stretching out into the lush, moonlit gardens that border the estate. The intricate details of their wedding attire, from the delicate lace on the bride’s gown to the polished sheen of the groom’s tuxedo, are illuminated by the amber glow of vintage lanterns positioned throughout the garden. Subtle notes of lavender and dusty rose distinguish the color palette, providing a harmonious backdrop that complements the romantic atmosphere, while the gentle rustle of leaves in the evening breeze adds a natural, serene soundscape. The photograph exudes a tactile richness, capturing the interplay between soft fabrics, the shimmering crystal of champagne flutes, and the vibrant textures of fresh blooms. It is styled as a fine art photograph, emphasizing elegance and sophistication, with each element deliberately chosen to enhance the narrative of this joyous celebration. The image is meticulously composed in high resolution, exhibiting sharp detail and an impeccable focus that allows every nuance of the scene to be appreciated, promising a timeless depiction of love and festivity.",
