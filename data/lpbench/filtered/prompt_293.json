  "prompt": "In a serene countryside village, an architectural masterpiece stands as a symbol of harmony between human creativity and nature’s splendor. This modern eco-friendly house integrates seamlessly into the rolling hills that embrace it, utilizing sustainable materials that reflect the earthy tones of its surroundings. The house, with its angular form and green rooftop, is designed to capture the changing play of sunlight throughout the day—mornings cast a warm glow over its eastern face, while afternoons see its western side bathed in softer, golden hues. Expansive glass walls allow an unobstructed view of the lush landscape beyond, inviting the verdant beauty indoors and creating a fluid connection between the home's interior and the scenic outdoors. This scene is captured from a slightly elevated perspective, enabling a comprehensive view of the house and its integration with the environment, centered within the frame to emphasize its importance yet open to the vast natural world around it. The foreground is punctuated by wildflower-filled meadows that stretch toward the structure, their vibrant colors adding a touch of liveliness against the house’s minimalist design. In the background, the gently undulating hills create a natural boundary that cocoons this architectural wonder. The lighting is soft and diffused, with fluffy white clouds casting gentle shadows across the landscape, enhancing the serene and tranquil atmosphere. A harmonious color palette of greens, browns, and soft whites contributes to a calm and inviting mood, evoking a sense of balance and peace. Photographed in a documentary style that captures the scene’s authentic beauty and intricate details, this image stands as a testament to both the architectural brilliance and the stunning landscape that frames it.",
