  "prompt": "As a formidable storm approaches, the landscape is transformed into a dramatic tableau of atmospheric intensity. Dominating the scene, an ancient, gnarled oak tree stands resolute at the edge of a rolling meadow, its twisted branches reaching skyward as if defying the tempest. The meadow stretches across the lower half of the image, lush and green, punctuated by patches of wildflowers swaying in the gusting wind. Beyond the tree, a tapestry of thick, boiling clouds advances, its swirling mass imbued with the ominous grays and purples of a charged atmosphere. Flashes of lightning intermittently illuminate the sky, casting fleeting shadows across the landscape and highlighting the texture of the tree's bark in stark relief. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated angle, positioning the viewer as an observer to nature's unfolding drama, with the oak tree offset to the left, providing a dynamic compositional balance. The depth of the scene is emphasized by the contrast between the vast meadow in the foreground and the approaching wall of clouds in the background. The light is a mix of the last vestiges of daylight and the electric brilliance of the storm, creating a chiaroscuro effect that lends a sense of urgency and motion to the tableau. The color palette shifts from the vibrant greens of the meadow to the dark, brooding hues of the storm, evoking a sense of anticipation and awe. Captured in a high-resolution format with impeccable sharpness, the image showcases the powerful interplay of natural forces and stands as a testament to the beauty and unpredictability of the elements.",
