  "prompt": "Set within a bustling urban environment, a newly designed boutique hotel serves as a contemporary marvel of modern architecture. Its sleek, minimalist design features a glass exterior that reflects the surrounding cityscape, creating a dynamic interplay between structure and skyline. The hotel stands elegantly at the corner of a busy intersection, offering both an inviting entrance and a sense of prominence in the neighborhood. Viewed from street level, the ground floor showcases expansive windows framed in dark metal, providing passersby with a glimpse into the vibrant and stylish lobby within. The composition is captured from a low angle to emphasize the hotel’s stature, with the corner of the building centered in the frame, creating a sense of symmetry and balance. Midground elements include bustling pedestrians and a few strategically planted urban trees, lending life and greenery to the concrete setting. A bright, late afternoon sun casts long shadows across the street, creating dramatic contrasts that highlight the building’s geometric lines and transparent surfaces. The atmosphere is vibrant and lively, with a clarity in the air that elevates the sharpness and detail of the scene. The color palette is dominated by cool steel blues and reflective silvers, with occasional pops of vibrant greenery to soften the urban landscape. The image captures the mood of urban sophistication and modern elegance, showcasing the hotel as a beacon of contemporary design within the city. The photographic style is polished and precise, using high dynamic range techniques to balance the light and bring out textural details in both the shadows and highlights. This professional-grade photograph conveys the technical excellence expected in high-quality real estate photography, with impeccable sharpness and detail that create a lasting impression of the property’s unique architectural features.",
