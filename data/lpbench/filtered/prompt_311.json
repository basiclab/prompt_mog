  "prompt": "In the heart of a bustling coastal city, an extraordinary piece of architecture commands the skyline—a maritime museum designed to resemble the cresting wave of the surrounding ocean. Its fluid form, a blend of sweeping curves and towering arches, emerges boldly from the shore, harmonizing with the rhythmic ebb and flow of the waves. The structure is crafted from a combination of polished steel and reflective glass, capturing the sunlight and creating a shimmering effect that mimics the dancing reflections of the sea. The museum, positioned at the edge of a man-made promontory, is seen from a mid-level perspective, allowing the viewer to appreciate the building's swooping roofline that extends dramatically toward the horizon. In the foreground, a series of elegant footbridges connect the museum to the bustling harbor, with the docks and moored yachts offering a sense of scale against the museum's grandeur. The atmosphere is illuminated by the warm glow of the setting sun, which bathes the scene in hues of gold and amber, casting long shadows across the waterfront. The sky is a tapestry of vibrant oranges and purples, complementing the silvery sheen of the museum's facade. The scene conveys a mood of innovation and creativity, celebrating the intersection of nature and human ingenuity. The architectural style is a fusion of organic modernism with maritime influences, showcasing fluid lines and open spaces designed to echo the natural environment. The image is captured with outstanding detail, highlighting the intricacies of the museum's design and the vibrant activity of the surrounding harbor, resulting in a visually striking and award-worthy composition.",
