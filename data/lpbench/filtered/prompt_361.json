  "prompt": "As dawn breaks over the quiet suburban enclave, a modern split-level home stands prominently at the end of a cul-de-sac, its sleek design a blend of glass, steel, and wood. The house, with its minimalist façade, is framed by manicured gardens and a cobblestone driveway that leads to an imposing pivot door. This domestic haven exudes a sense of tranquility and modernity, aimed at capturing the hearts of discerning urban professionals. The camera captures this from a slight elevation, emphasizing the open-plan architecture that seamlessly integrates indoor and outdoor spaces, highlighting a spacious living area that opens onto a sunlit patio through expansive sliding glass doors. The interior, bathed in the soft light of a rising sun, features a muted color palette of whites, grays, and natural wood tones which harmonize to create a calming and inviting atmosphere. Decor is understated yet sophisticated, with a Scandinavian influence evident in the clean lines and functionality of the furniture. Outside, the garden is alive with the delicate hues of early morning blooms, their colors subtly enhancing the home's contemporary elegance. The overall visual style is that of premium lifestyle photography, with sharpness and clarity capturing the structural nuances and material textures in fine detail. This high-resolution image aims for an editorial quality, showcasing the house as an aspirational luxury with its seamless balance of nature and design.",
