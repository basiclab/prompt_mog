  "prompt": "Under a tempestuous sky, a solitary stone lighthouse stands as a vigilant sentinel on the jagged edge of a rocky coastline. The lighthouse, worn by time and elements, exhibits a stoic resilience against the unforgiving forces of nature. The scene captures a powerful juxtaposition between the man-made structure and the relentless energy of the approaching storm. Viewed from a lower vantage point at the base of the cliff, the camera angle accentuates the towering presence of the lighthouse against the churning sky. The foreground reveals the rugged textures of the rocks, their rough surfaces slick with the advance of the tide. Beyond, the lighthouse looms, centered within the composition as the focal point, its light piercing through the building gloom. Massive cumulus clouds dominate the background, their towering forms illuminated by sporadic flashes of lightning, casting a dynamic interplay of light and shadow across the landscape. The atmosphere is charged with the electric tension of an impending storm, where strong winds whip through the landscape, bending the hardy coastal grasses and sending sprays of surf into the air. A predominantly cool palette of deep blues and grays is punctuated by the warm, inviting glow of the lighthouse's beacon, introducing an element of hope and guidance amidst the chaos. The scene evokes a cinematic sense of drama and foreboding, reminiscent of classic maritime paintings yet captured with the high fidelity of modern digital photography. The intricate details and the sharp focus lend the image a sense of immediacy and presence, offering a masterful depiction of the raw power and beauty of nature's fury poised on the brink of eruption.",
