  "prompt": "Perched atop a charming hillside, a lavish modern villa commands the horizon, offering sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. Its architecture is a masterful blend of contemporary design and sustainable living, featuring sleek lines, expansive glass facades, and eco-friendly materials. This property, encapsulating luxury and innovation, is captured from a slightly elevated aerial perspective, accentuating its prominent perch on the hillside and seamlessly integrating it with the expansive landscape. At the heart of the composition, a spacious terrace juts outward, framed by lush, native vegetation that both decorates the villa and fosters a seamless transition between the interior and the natural world. Morning light pours over the villa, casting a warm, inviting glow over its minimalist yet elegant design. The sun’s rays filter through strategically placed skylights, illuminating the open-plan living spaces and highlighting the textured surfaces and natural wood finishes that define the villa's interior. A gentle mist lingers at the base of the hillside, lending a soft atmospheric touch that enhances the tranquility of the scene. The color palette is a harmonious blend of muted earth tones, from the stone-gray exterior to the soft green of the surrounding vegetation, all under a baby blue sky. This creates a serene, inviting atmosphere that evokes a sense of peaceful, upscale living. The visual style is crisp and polished, aligning with the aesthetic of high-end real estate photography, combining technical precision with an artistic eye for capturing the allure of luxury living spaces. The image is rendered with remarkable clarity and sharpness, offering an immersive view that feels both inviting and aspirational, epitomizing quality and sophistication. Capturing the essence of high-end property marketing, this scene speaks to potential buyers seeking a harmonious blend of modern luxury and natural beauty.",
