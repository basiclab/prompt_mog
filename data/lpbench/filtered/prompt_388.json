  "prompt": "In a charming hillside neighborhood, a newly constructed three-story home stands proudly, embodying a perfect blend of modern architecture and natural elegance. Set against a backdrop of rolling green hills, the property spans a generous plot, surrounded by carefully manicured gardens filled with vibrant perennial flowers and mature trees. The house features large, contemporary windows that reflect the azure sky and allow ample natural light to flood the interiors. The scene is captured from a slightly elevated vantage point, offering a comprehensive view of the house. The framing captures the lush garden as a welcoming foreground, with a sleek stone pathway leading the eye towards the home's grand entrance. The architecture of the home presents a striking contrast between clean, white walls and the warm tones of a sustainably sourced timber cladding that wraps around portions of the facade, providing a touch of rustic charm. The house is bathed in the soft glow of late afternoon sunlight, which casts gentle shadows that accentuate the architectural lines and textures. The atmosphere is serene and inviting, with a gentle breeze rustling the leaves of the surrounding trees, adding to the peaceful ambiance. A muted color palette of whites, browns, and greens dominates the scene, evoking a sense of harmony and tranquility. The image is styled with an editorial flair, emphasizing sharp details and a polished finish that enhances the overall elegance of the property. High-resolution imagery allows every detail, from the texture of the stone path to the vibrant petals of the flowers, to be captured with stunning clarity. The photograph embodies professional craftsmanship, ensuring that the property is portrayed with both accuracy and aesthetic appeal, making it an enticing prospect for potential buyers.",
