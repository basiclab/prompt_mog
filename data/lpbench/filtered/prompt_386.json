  "prompt": "In the heart of a serene suburban enclave, a stately Georgian-style townhome emerges as a masterclass in architectural refinement, exuding timeless elegance through its symmetric brick façade and tall, white windows that gleam under the clear afternoon sky. This high-end residence is positioned prominently at the end of a cul-de-sac, offering a tranquil vista over the manicured neighborhood. Captured from a moderately elevated angle, the photograph highlights the home's grand entrance, adorned with classical columns and a polished mahogany door that serves as the focal point of the composition. In the foreground, a neatly trimmed hedge-lined pathway leads the viewer toward the entrance, flanked by vibrant rose bushes that add a splash of color to the composition. Sunlight pours over the property, casting soft shadows across the lawn and illuminating the intricate brickwork, while a gentle breeze sways the foliage, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still scene. The color palette is a harmonious blend of soft earth tones from the bricks and lush greens from the surrounding landscape, establishing a warm and welcoming ambiance. The style of the image leans towards fine art photography, with an emphasis on crisp detail and a balanced composition that elevates the home's prestigious demeanor. With professional-grade clarity and sharpness, the photograph serves not just as documentation, but as an invitation to step into a space where classic design meets modern luxury.",
