  "prompt": "In the heart of a vast and untouched wilderness, lies a breathtaking expanse where rolling prairies and rugged cliffs converge under a sky painted with hues of early dawn. A colossal waterfall cascades down the cliffs, its roaring waters merging into a lazy river winding through the lush green of the valley floor. Enormous ancient trees stand sentry around this natural amphitheater, their gnarled branches reaching out as if in whispered conversation with the breeze. Viewed from a high vantage point, the landscape stretches out immensely, with a soft morning mist lingering just above the ground, providing an ethereal contrast to the stark clarity of the cliffs' edge. In the foreground, delicate clusters of wildflowers introduce vibrant pops of color, their petals glistening with morning dew as they sway gently in the breeze. The entire scene is bathed in the gentle glow of the rising sun, casting long shadows and adding a touch of warmth to the otherwise cool early morning palette of blues, greens, and soft golds. The atmosphere feels serene yet dynamic, capturing the raw, breathtaking beauty of a world untrammeled by time. This photographic moment is captured in vivid detail, showcasing the intricacies of texture from the craggy cliffs to the velvety meadows, brought to life in an expansive panoramic format that invites the viewer to linger and explore every nook and cranny of this natural masterpiece.",
