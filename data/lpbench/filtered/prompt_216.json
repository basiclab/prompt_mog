  "prompt": "A dramatic display of nature's grandeur unfolds as a massive supercell thunderstorm looms ominously over a sprawling midwestern plain. The central focus is a cluster of mature oak trees, their gnarled branches reaching skyward as if in defiance of the tempest's approach. The scene is captured from a wide-angle perspective, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape and the sheer magnitude of the storm. The horizon stretches across the frame, anchoring the viewer's eye to the evenly spaced oaks in the midground, their silhouettes stark against the churning mass of dark, billowing cumulus clouds that dominate the background. In the foreground, a patchwork of sunlit wildflowers in radiant hues of purple, yellow, and white stands out against the muted greens and browns of the grassland, providing a vibrant contrast to the foreboding sky. The image captures the transition from late afternoon into early evening, with the sun casting an ethereal, golden glow across the scene, momentarily piercing through the tumultuous clouds with shafts of light that illuminate the landscape in a surreal and fleeting beauty. Shadows elongate across the ground, enhancing the sense of depth and drama. The color palette is a dynamic interplay of warm golden tones juxtaposed with cool grays and deep blues, evoking a mood of impending drama and anticipation. The photographic style is reminiscent of classic landscape art, with a high-resolution, finely detailed finish that captures every nuance of texture and form. The scene conveys both the serenity of the landscape and the awe-inspiring power of the storm, showcasing the inherent beauty and unpredictability of weather at its most intense. The image is technically precise, demonstrating masterful control over exposure and composition, resulting in a breathtaking depiction of atmospheric spectacle.",
