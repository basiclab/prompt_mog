  "prompt": "In the heart of an unfolding meteorological spectacle, the scene opens with an expansive, storm-tossed ocean, its surface a tumultuous interplay of shadow and light. Towering, multifaceted storm clouds rear their colossal forms high into the sky, a dynamic tableau of swirling grays and menacing blacks, their edges jagged and defined as if carved by a celestial hand. Lightning crackles across the heavens, illuminating the turbulent seascape with brief flashes of electric blue. This dramatic vista is captured from a vantage point on a rocky shoreline, where the foreground is dominated by jagged, weather-beaten rocks, their surfaces slicked with the constant spray of ocean brine. In the midground, the waves crash relentlessly against the rugged coast, each cresting whitecap rising like a spectral phantom before dissipating against the immovable rock. Farther out, the horizon is lost in the thundering mass of the storm, a boundaryless meeting of sea and sky that conveys both majesty and foreboding. Under this roiling sky, the scant light of the late afternoon filters through, casting eerie, angular shadows that emphasize the raw texture of the scene. The color palette embraces the cool, monochromatic tones of an impending storm, with mineral grays, deep ocean blues, and the ephemeral white of frothing waves set against the stark, charcoal silhouettes of the clouds. The atmosphere is charged with a palpable tension, a herald of nature's uncompromising power. The image is portrayed in the style of high-contrast black and white photography, where each element of the scene is rendered with razor-sharp clarity, highlighting the intricate detail and movement within the natural world. Masterful in its execution, this photograph captures the sublime beauty and terrifying grandeur of a storm at sea, an award-worthy testament to the art of weather photography.",
