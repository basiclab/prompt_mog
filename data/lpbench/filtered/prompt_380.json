  "prompt": "Nestled amidst a verdant landscape, a meticulously crafted modern residence stands as a testament to architectural elegance. This two-story house, with its distinctive L-shaped design, is showcased under the bright midday sun. Its facade blends natural stone and glass seamlessly, reflecting the surrounding lush greenery and the azure sky above. The photographer captures this scene from a slightly elevated position across the manicured lawn, providing an unobstructed panoramic view that gracefully sweeps from the expansive front garden, with its meticulously trimmed hedges, to the sleek, infinity edge pool that mirrors the sky. A paved driveway curves gently toward the entrance, flanked by sculptural topiary and understated outdoor lighting fixtures, guiding the eye inward. Entering the home, visitors are greeted by an open-plan living space bathed in soft natural light that pours through floor-to-ceiling windows. The interiors are appointed with minimalist furniture in a palette of soft grays and warm wood tones, fostering a sense of calm and sophistication. The kitchen, with its marble countertops and state-of-the-art appliances, opens into a cozy dining area that overlooks the garden through sliding glass doors. Ambient lighting casts gentle shadows and highlights elegant textures, from the polished concrete floors to the rich, grainy patterns of the wooden beams. A neutral color scheme of whites, grays, and earth tones imbues the space with tranquility, punctuated by the vibrant green of indoor plants. The photographic style is clean and precise, emphasizing the crisp lines and perfect symmetry of the design. With razor-sharp focus and masterful composition, the image captures the essence of contemporary luxury living, promising both comfort and style.",
