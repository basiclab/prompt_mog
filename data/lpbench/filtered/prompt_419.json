  "prompt": "From a high-altitude drone perspective, the serene tableau of a vast savanna unfolds beneath the lens, where golden grasses undulate like waves in a sea of warmth. The focal point of the composition is a solitary acacia tree, standing resilient amidst the endless expanse, its umbrella-like canopy offering the only significant shadow on the sun-drenched earth below. Herds of wildebeest move with a synchronized grace across the landscape, their migration creating a dynamic ribbon of movement that flows in harmony with the gentle curves of the land. Beyond them, clusters of zebras, interspersed with gazelles, animate the scene with their contrasting stripes and agile leaps, painting a living tapestry against the backdrop of the open plains. The camera angle is a bird’s-eye view, centrally aligned to emphasize the acacia and its surrounding environment, while the distant horizon stretches infinitely, punctuated by the faint silhouette of distant mountains merging with the sky. The natural light is bright and unfiltered, casting a vivid glow that enhances the ochre and sienna tones of the savanna, while the clear azure sky above adds a striking contrast, injecting a sense of tranquility and space. This interplay of colors reflects the untamed yet harmonious spirit of the African wilderness, capturing the essence of its raw beauty. The landscape is depicted with cinematic clarity, each detail rendered with precision to convey the textures of the savanna grasses and the gentle ripples of a small river meandering in the distance, adding a subtle yet integral element to the scene. Photographically, the image embodies the grandeur of fine art nature photography, combining the sweeping elegance of aerial views with the intimate detail of wildlife portraiture. The final composition is a high-resolution masterpiece, exuding a professional quality that celebrates the majesty and complexity of nature from an unrivaled vantage point.",
