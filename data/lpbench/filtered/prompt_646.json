  "prompt": "In an upscale, warmly lit patisserie located in a bustling Parisian neighborhood, a culinary masterpiece is meticulously staged. At the center of the scene is a delicate mille-feuille, layered with golden, flaky pastry and interspersed with vibrant vanilla custard. The dessert is artfully adorned with a dusting of powdered sugar, lending an ethereal quality to its presentation. A petite fork rests daintily beside the dessert on a pristine, white porcelain plate, while a silver spoon gleams just within reach. The composition is captured from a slightly elevated, three-quarter angle, focusing closely on the mille-feuille to emphasize its intricate layers and textures. In the foreground, a scattering of fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint provide a burst of color and freshness, inviting the viewer to indulge in the culinary delights of the scene. Natural light streams through a nearby lattice window, casting soft shadows and highlights across the tabletop, while the gentle hum of the patisserie’s patrons creates an ambiance of leisurely refinement. The rich, warm tones of amber and cream in the pastry are complemented by the deep red of the raspberries, crafting a harmonious color palette that evokes comfort and indulgence. This scene is rendered in a style reminiscent of classical still-life oil paintings, where the contrast between the textures of the pastry and the smooth porcelain invites a tactile appreciation. Photographic excellence is evident in the crisp, high-resolution details, capturing the finesse of each pastry layer and the subtle sheen of the custard, portraying an inviting narrative of culinary artistry and elegance.",
