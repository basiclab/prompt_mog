  "theme": "Surreal Photography",
  "prompt": "In an ethereal world that transcends the ordinary realms of reality, an ancient, intricately carved stone bridge arcs gracefully across a chasm filled with swirling nebula-like mist. Perched on this bridge is a majestic lion, its mane made not of fur, but of radiant golden flames that flicker and dance in the gentle breeze. The lion gazes regally across the surreal expanse, its eyes glowing with a deep, knowing luminescence. This enchanted creature seems to guard the passageway, a timeless sentinel watching over this dreamlike landscape. Below the bridge, the mist roils and shifts, colored in iridescent shades of violet, cerulean, and emerald, as if an aurora has found its home within the earth. The scene is viewed from a slightly elevated perspective, the bridge stretching diagonally across the frame from the lower left forefront to the upper right, guiding the viewer's gaze into the mystic expanse beyond. In the distance, the horizon is obscured by shimmering, translucent clouds that catch the light of two identical suns, their brilliance suffusing the scene with a warm, amber glow. Silvery light reflections ripple along the stone of the bridge, contrasting with the deep shadows that play beneath the archway. The dominant colors are rich ochres and vibrant blues, with the nebula mist providing an ever-changing backdrop of complementary hues. The mood is one of awe and wonder, evoking feelings of mystical guardianship and the eternal dance of light and shadow. Rendered in a style reminiscent of fantasy realism, the image captures fine details with a professional level of sharpness and clarity, revealing the texture of weathered stone and the ethereal quality of the lion's fiery mane. The composition exudes a sense of quiet power and transcendental serenity, drawing the viewer into a world where the boundaries of reality and imagination blend seamlessly, inviting exploration and contemplation of the unknown.",
