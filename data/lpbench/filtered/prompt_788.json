  "prompt": "In a hidden corner of a bustling city, a sleek, retro-inspired custom motorcycle stands proudly beneath the arching steel beams of an old railway bridge. Its polished chrome accents and matte graphite finish are complemented by the contrasting orange leather seat, evoking a blend of vintage charm and modern sophistication. The motorcycle is situated at the center of the frame, viewed from a low, slightly elevated angle that accentuates its muscular stance and intricate detailing. In the background, the silhouette of the bridge looms large, stretching into the distance and drawing the eye towards the fading skyline of the metropolis beyond. Afternoon sunlight filters through the lattice of the bridge, casting dynamic patterns of light and shadow across the scene, illuminating the bike's contours with a soft, golden glow that highlights its craftsmanship. The interplay between the warm sunlight and the cool tones of the bridge creates an atmospheric tension, enhancing the feeling of nostalgic elegance that permeates the scene. The color palette is a sophisticated mix of muted graphite and steel blues, juxtaposed with the warm, rich tones of the leather and the golden hour light, creating a harmonious yet dynamic visual narrative. Elements such as the texture of the cobblestone street and the distant hum of city life add depth and authenticity to the composition, inviting the viewer to linger on the intricate details and the urban setting. Captured in high-resolution with cinematic precision, this image conveys a sense of timeless style and refined artistry that is further emphasized by the careful balance of light and shadow, ensuring that the motorcycle remains the undeniable focal point of this evocative urban tableau.",
