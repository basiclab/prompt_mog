  "prompt": "In the ornate ballroom of a grand historical hotel, a lavish wedding celebration is in full bloom, seamlessly blending opulence with heartfelt intimacy. White lilies and pink roses, meticulously arranged in gilded vases, adorn every table, while shimmering fairy lights cascade like waterfalls from the vaulted ceilings. The bride, dressed in a stunning vintage lace gown, gracefully sweeps across the polished marble floor, her train flowing elegantly behind her. Her groom, in a tailored midnight-blue tuxedo, holds her hand gently, their eyes locked in a timeless gaze, capturing a moment of pure connection. Guests, clad in elegant evening attire, mingle around the couple, their laughter and conversations merging into a soft, joyous murmur. The photographer captures this enchanting scene from a slightly elevated angle near the entrance, allowing the viewer to take in the grandeur of the room. In the foreground, the couple takes center stage, while the large gilded mirrors and cascading drapes frame the background, enhancing the room's depth and creating a stunning visual symmetry. Evening light, filtered through the tall, arched windows, bathes the ballroom in a soft, golden glow, casting delicate shadows that dance along the walls. The atmosphere is one of romantic elegance, with a color palette dominated by creamy whites, soft pinks, and rich golds, evoking a sense of warmth and timeless beauty. The photographer employs a documentary photojournalism style to authentically capture this cherished event with a sharp focus on both the grand scenery and the intimate details, resulting in an image that is both professionally composed and emotionally resonant.",
