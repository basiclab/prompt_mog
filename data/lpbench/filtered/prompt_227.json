  "prompt": "In the heart of a sprawling coastal marshland, an imposing bank of thunderheads looms ominously on the horizon. These colossal clouds, dark and dense, are brimming with the promise of a tempest about to be unleashed. Veins of lightning intermittently fracture the sky, their jagged brilliance illuminating the tumultuous cloudscape in fleeting, electric flashes. Below, the marshland stretches out, a tapestry of emerald grasses and sinuous waterways that weave a serene contrast to the chaos above. The perspective is set from a low angle, accentuating the dominance of the sky and intensifying the approaching storm's sense of scale and power. The foreground is filled with wind-blown reeds, swaying wildly as the first gusts of the storm make landfall, their motion a prelude to the impending deluge. The marsh sits nestled against a distant backdrop of rolling dunes, barely visible beneath a veil of heavy mist that hangs low over the landscape. As the storm approaches, the atmosphere thickens with humidity, and the air takes on a tangible weight, charged with static. Catching the last rays of a sun all but obscured, the water surfaces mirror the brooding sky, creating a hauntingly beautiful chiaroscuro effect. The overall color palette shifts dramatically; deep charcoal grays of the clouds are punctuated by the brief, stark whites of lightning and softened by the muted greens and browns of the marshland. This dramatic interplay of light and shadow casts a somber mood over the scene, a testament to nature's raw and unpredictable power. The scene is captured with the precision of fine-art landscape photography, emphasizing detail and texture, from the intricate patterns of the water's surface to the wisps of clouds curling into the storm. Every element is meticulously framed in a wide, cinematic composition that draws viewers into the unfolding meteorological drama.",
