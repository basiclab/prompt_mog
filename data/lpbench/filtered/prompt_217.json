  "prompt": "As dawn breaks on the horizon, a lush, rolling countryside is dramatically transformed under the brewing intensity of an approaching storm. A solitary, ancient oak tree stands majestically at the center of the scene, its gnarled branches reaching defiantly toward a tumultuous sky. The tree anchors the landscape, surrounded by an expansive field of wildflowers, swaying gently in the rising wind. The camera captures this scene from a low angle, emphasizing the towering presence of the oak and the vastness of the storm-laden clouds looming above. The horizon stretches out to the left of the frame, offering a glimpse of distant hills disappearing into the storm's oncoming embrace. Morning light struggles to pierce through the dense canopy of cumulonimbus clouds, casting diffused, ghostly shadows across the field and creating an eerie yet captivating chiaroscuro effect. Lightning sporadically illuminates the sky, casting quicksilver paths against the dark, brooding atmosphere. The color palette is dominated by cool grays and deep blues, punctuated by the vibrant greens of the landscape and the stark white flashes of lightning, conveying a mood of both serenity and impending drama. The scene is rendered in the style of hyper-realistic fine art photography, where every drop of rain and every blade of grass is captured in exquisite detail, offering an immersive experience. High dynamic range settings ensure the highlights of the lightning and the shadows of the clouds are perfectly balanced, resulting in a visually arresting tableau worthy of an award-winning gallery display.",
