  "prompt": "In an otherworldly realm where the impossible becomes reality, an enormous, floating castle constructed entirely of luminescent jellyfish sails through an opalescent sky. Each jellyfish shimmers with its own rainbow of colors, their translucent bodies casting a soft, ethereal glow that interacts with the surrounding atmosphere. The castle's turrets and towers undulate gracefully as if breathing, their surfaces a continuous ripple of vibrant hues. Below, a vast ocean made of liquid silver reflects the castle above, creating an infinite loop of shimmering scenery. The scene is captured from a wide-angle perspective, encapsulating the full grandeur of the floating castle while providing a sense of endless space in all directions. The horizon blends seamlessly into the sky, obscured by a delicate, swirling mist that adds a dreamlike quality to the scene. As the scene unfolds, the interplay between light and color creates an ever-changing tableau, where the castle appears both solid and ephemeral, like a mirage on the edge of perception. The dominant colors are iridescent blues, greens, and purples, lending a sense of calm and mystery to the environment. The overall mood is one of ethereal serenity, inviting viewers to pause and reflect on the boundary between reality and imagination. The photographic style is one of high dynamic range, capturing minute details in both the vibrant highlights and the subtle shadows, resulting in a visually arresting spectacle. The technical precision is evident in the sharpness of the jellyfish castle's details, each undulating motion captured crisply as if frozen in time, yet alive with possibilities.",
