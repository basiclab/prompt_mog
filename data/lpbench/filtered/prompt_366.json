  "prompt": "An elegant contemporary penthouse apartment unfolds its charm, sitting atop a state-of-the-art high-rise tower, set against the bustling backdrop of a metropolitan skyline. The expansive living room is showcased with panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows, drawing the viewer's gaze out to the sprawling city views beyond. Adjacent to the living room is a minimalist kitchen with sleek, polished white marble countertops and high-tech stainless steel appliances, epitomizing modern luxury and functionality. Warm, natural sunlight streams through the windows, casting soft reflections on the flawless glass surfaces and illuminating the subtle hues of the sophisticated interior palette. Shades of muted grays and soft blues dominate the color scheme, evoking a sense of calm and understated elegance, while bold art pieces add splashes of vibrant color. In the cozy reading nook, plush leather chairs invite relaxation, positioned strategically to capture both the natural light and a view of the cityscape. The high-quality image captures every detail with professional clarity, from the texture of the rich hardwood flooring to the intricacy of the modern light fixtures overhead, highlighting the seamless blend of style and functionality that defines this urban sanctuary.",
