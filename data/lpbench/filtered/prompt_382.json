  "prompt": "Situated at the heart of a serene suburban area, a freshly constructed modern townhouse stands proudly, its sleek lines and innovative design drawing the attention of passersby. The property features an impressive facade, combining large glass panels with warm wooden accents that beautifully reflect the surrounding greenery. Captured from a slightly elevated perspective, the entire structure is framed to highlight its unique architectural layout, with a focus on the contrast between the solid concrete elements and the transparent glass surfaces. The spacious front lawn, meticulously landscaped, stretches across the foreground, leading towards the entrance, while a paved walkway accented by strategically placed LED lights gently guides visitors up to the front door. Mid-afternoon sunlight washes over the scene, casting soft, diffused shadows that add depth to the geometry of the building, reflecting off the windows with a gentle glare that enhances the modern aesthetic. The color palette is predominantly composed of earthy tones and muted grays, balanced by the lush greens of the garden, creating a harmonious and inviting ambiance. Inside, a glimpse through the windows reveals a cozy living space adorned with minimalist furniture, suggesting a lifestyle of comfort and ease. This real estate photograph employs the principles of architectural photography, with meticulous attention to detail and composition, ensuring that every aspect of the property is captured in its best light. The resulting image is a crisp, high-resolution portrayal, showcasing the property’s potential as a modern family home while emphasizing its integration with the tranquil environment around it.",
