  "prompt": "In the sunlit warmth of a contemporary kitchen, a vibrant culinary masterpiece takes shape on a wide, rustic wooden table. The focal point of this delicious scene is a beautifully plated dish of fresh seafood, crowned with succulent, glistening lobster tail, surrounded by a medley of colorful, neatly diced vegetables like bell peppers, carrots, and snow peas. This culinary creation is flanked by a pair of elegantly arranged side dishes, each featuring heirloom tomatoes in a rainbow of hues and delicate sprigs of basil that add aromatic allure. The setting is completed with sleek utensils that catch the light and crystal-clear glasses of sparkling water, their surfaces glistening with condensation. Captured from a slightly elevated angle, the camera looks down upon the table, allowing the viewer to take in the entire spread in one glance. The composition is carefully balanced with the main dish prominently positioned in the middle, while the side dishes and utensils subtly frame it, creating a harmonious visual rhythm. The soft natural light from an overhead window bathes the table in a warm, inviting glow, casting gentle shadows that add depth and dimension to the scene. The color palette is a feast for the eyes with vibrant reds, greens, and oranges set against the earthy tones of the wooden table, evoking a sense of freshness and abundance. The mood is one of refined elegance yet approachable warmth, inviting the viewer to savor the artistry and flavor of this culinary presentation. This image embodies the crisp precision of professional culinary photography, highlighting the textures and intricate details with remarkable clarity and focus, ensuring that every element on the table looks as if it could almost be touched.",
