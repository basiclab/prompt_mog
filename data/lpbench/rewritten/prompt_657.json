  "prompt": "Nestled in the heart of an intimate, cozy café, a culinary marvel graces the center of a reclaimed wooden table, its rustic texture offering a charming contrast to the sophistication of the dish. The main subject is a perfectly plated ensemble of seared duck breast, artfully arranged on a hand-thrown ceramic plate, its surface a muted canvas of earthy tones. Rich, golden brown slices of duck are fanned out like a visual symphony, accompanied by a delicate smear of vibrant cranberry reduction and a scattering of crisped sage leaves, their verdant color adding a touch of freshness to the composition. Captured from a bird’s-eye view, the scene invites the viewer to appreciate not just the dish, but the whole table setting. The shallow depth of field centers the focus on the plate, while softly blurring the background elements—a small vase with lavender sprigs and a half-filled glass of deep red wine. Bathed in warm ambient light streaming through the café's large front window, the setting exudes a welcoming, serene atmosphere. The sunlight gently caresses the duck breast, highlighting its succulent texture and creating a tantalizing play of light and shadow across the plate. The color palette leans towards warm and inviting hues, with rich browns, deep reds, and forest greens creating a harmonious and appetizing tableau. The composition is captured in a style reminiscent of classic food photography, emphasizing natural light and minimalistic elegance. The high-resolution image ensures that every detail is exquisitely sharp, from the subtle grain of the wooden table to the glistening juices on the duck. This professional-level photograph is a testament to the art of culinary presentation, embodying both gastronomic and visual delight.",
