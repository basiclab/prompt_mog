  "prompt": "In the heart of a sprawling, untouched wilderness, a dramatic interplay between earth and sky unfolds. The scene is dominated by a vast, swirling tempest that churns ominously above, its layers of towering cumulonimbus clouds illuminated by the jagged forks of lightning that streak across the sky. The landscape below is a tapestry of rugged, untamed terrain—a rocky plateau with sparse, gnarled trees bravely clinging to life despite the storm's fury. The camera captures this scene from a slightly elevated angle, positioned above the plateau and facing towards the storm's epicenter, giving an expansive view that encompasses both the wild landscape and the turbulent sky. In the foreground, the edges of the plateau are fringed by twisted shrubs and hardy grasses, their colors muted by the dim, stormy light. The middle ground features solitary trees, their branches contorted and silhouetted against the roiling clouds, adding a stark contrast to the soft, diffused lighting that envelops the scene. At the horizon, the sky is a dramatic canvas of dark grays and purples, interspersed with the brilliant whites of lightning flashes, creating a dynamic, almost otherworldly atmosphere. The air feels electrically charged, and the mood is one of awe and anticipation, as nature's raw power is laid bare. This scene is rendered in strikingly realistic detail, capturing the textures of the cloud formations and the subtle interplay of light and shadow on the landscape, reminiscent of professional storm photography where every element is sharp, clear, and meticulously composed to maximize impact and drama.",

    "Amidst a vast, unspoiled wilderness, a dramatic scene unfolds between earth and sky. Dominating the view is a massive, swirling storm with towering cumulonimbus clouds, illuminated by lightning forks slicing through the sky. The rugged terrain below features a rocky plateau with sparse, twisted trees fighting against the storm's strength. The view is captured from a slightly higher angle above the plateau, facing the storm's core, offering a sweeping perspective that includes both the wild landscape and the turbulent heavens. In the foreground, the plateau's edges are lined with twisted shrubs and hardy grasses, their hues dulled by the stormy light. The middle ground highlights solitary trees, their branches twisted and silhouetted against the churning clouds, contrasting with the diffused lighting bathing the scene. At the horizon, the sky is an intense blend of dark grays and purples, punctuated by bright lightning flashes, creating a dynamic, almost surreal environment. The air feels electrically charged, infusing the mood with awe and anticipation as nature's formidable power is on full display. This scene is depicted with remarkably realistic detail, capturing the textures of the clouds and the nuanced play of light and shadow on the landscape, akin to expert storm photography where every detail is vivid, precise, and deliberately arranged to enhance impact and drama.",
