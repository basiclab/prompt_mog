  "prompt": "In the heart of a dreamlike landscape, an enormous celestial whale glides gracefully through a sky that mirrors the vastness of the ocean below. The whale's body shimmers with iridescent hues, its surface reflecting the ethereal colors of the cosmos. Below, a surreal expanse of ocean stretches infinitely, its surface a seamless mirror reflecting the heavens above. This scene is captured from a high angle that accentuates the surreal interplay between sky and sea, creating an almost abstract composition where the boundaries between water and air are blurred. In the foreground, misty tendrils of cloud reach down towards the whale, casting soft, diffuse shadows that dance lightly over its surface. The atmosphere is imbued with a sense of peaceful otherworldliness, as if time itself has slowed to allow this majestic creature to traverse the airy depths undisturbed. The color palette is a harmonious blend of rich indigo and luminous silver, punctuated by the opalescent glow of distant cosmic phenomena. The emotional tone is one of serene wonder, inviting introspection and awe at the beauty of the surreal scene unfolding in the sky. The overall style of this image draws from surrealistic photography, evoking the works of those who capture the fantastical and the impossible in striking realism. The technical attributes of the image are masterfully executed, with a sharpness and clarity that highlights the intricate details of the whale's scales and the soft, diffused transitions between light and shadow. This composition epitomizes the concept of surreal photography, where the unimagined is visually realized with impeccable artistry.",
