  "prompt": "An intense weather spectacle unfolds over the vast, open plains, where an imposing supercell thunderstorm battles against a sea of tall, waving grasses. In the foreground, the vivid green of the plants contrasts starkly with the ominous, churning sky full of dark greys and flashes of electric blue. The viewer, positioned at ground level, gets an immersive perspective as if standing amidst the grass, looking up at the towering clouds swirling with a furious energy. Thunder rumbles from above as forks of lightning sporadically pierce the moody atmosphere, forming jagged paths across the sky. Above, the storm clouds billow into monumental formations, their textures varying from smooth, menacing anvils to turbulent, boiling masses, suggesting both density and movement. It is early evening, and the natural light is low, casting a dim, almost surreal glow over the landscape, highlighting the frothy edges of the clouds and outlining the undulating horizon. The color palette balances the sharp brilliance of lightning and the deep, foreboding blues and purples of the storm clouds, with the occasional golden hue peeking through when the sun manages a brief appearance. This scene is captured in a high-definition cinematic style, where every detail from the blades of grass to the atmospheric depth is sharply rendered, providing an overwhelming sense of nature's raw and untamed power. The composition intentionally places the viewer in the midst of the scene, creating an engaging experience that contrasts the familiar with the extraordinary.",
