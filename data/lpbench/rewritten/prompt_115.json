  "prompt": "In the ethereal twilight of a mist-enshrouded Southeast Asian wetland, a riveting wildlife drama unfolds against the backdrop of lush greenery and reflective, calm waters. The protagonist of this narrative is a rare, endangered Bornean clouded leopard, its dappled fur blending seamlessly with the interplay of shadows and diffused light filtering through the thick canopy above. This elusive creature slinks gracefully along the edge of a rippling water body, its every move a testament to its stealth and agility. The camera captures the scene from a low, unobtrusive angle, placing the viewer at eye level with the leopard, thus immersing them in the feline's domain. The depth of field is carefully managed to keep the focus on the leopard in the foreground, while the midground is softly bokeh, with the background fading into the misty horizon, evoking a sense of vastness and wild, untamed beauty. As the setting sun dips below the horizon, the dimming light casts an aura of gentle warmth, causing the golden and russet hues of the leopard's fur to glow amidst the cooler shades of the surrounding jungle. This natural chiaroscuro effect heightens the mood of intrigue and mystery. The palette is a harmonious blend of rich earth tones with bursts of verdant greens and the watery blues of the wetland, creating a tranquil yet vibrant tableau. The photograph is styled with the precision and artistry of fine art wildlife photography, emphasizing the majesty and endangered nature of its subject. Shot with high-resolution equipment, the image showcases the texture of the leopard’s fur, the subtle ripples in the water, and the intricate details of the surrounding foliage with striking clarity, evoking the grandeur and fragility of this rare encounter.",
