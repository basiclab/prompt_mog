  "prompt": "In the tranquil embrace of a remote coastal cliff, an ancient stone lighthouse stands proud, its weathered façade silently observing the night sky ablaze with astral wonders. The scene is set at the edge of a craggy shoreline where the rhythmic murmur of waves kissing the rocks adds a serene dimension to the night. Overhead, the cosmos unfurls in a breathtaking display; myriad stars glint like diamonds scattered across the velvet of infinity. The Milky Way, a river of light, arches majestically across the sky, its dense clusters of stars and nebulae suffusing the darkness with ethereal luminescence. Captured from a low vantage point, the composition draws the eye up from the lighthouse in the foreground, past the jagged rocks awash in moonlight, and into the celestial spectacle above. The lighthouse, a sentinel against the backdrop of infinity, serves as a point of contrast against the seemingly boundless universe. Moonlight bathes the scene in a cool, silvery glow, softening the ruggedness of the rocks and lending the landscape a dreamlike quality. A gentle breeze stirs, carrying the salty tang of the ocean, and causes the lighthouse's distant light to flicker intermittently, adding a touch of life to the stillness. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and inky blacks of the night sky interspersed with the shimmering white and golden hues of starlight, evoking a mood of quiet wonder and infinite possibility. The photograph captures the essence of astrophotography, blending the stark beauty of Earth and the vast mystery of the cosmos. The image is rendered with stunning clarity, every star and geological detail sharp against the serene void, showcasing the technical prowess behind the lens.",
