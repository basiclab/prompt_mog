  "prompt": "A sweeping panorama unfolds from the rugged cliffs of a remote coastal headland, where the endless ocean stretches toward the horizon, its azure waters blending seamlessly with the sky. In the foreground, the jagged rocks are covered in emerald green moss, hinting at the relentless, salty winds that have shaped this wild landscape over centuries. Waves crash rhythmically against the base of the cliffs, sending plumes of white spray into the air, glittering in the soft glow of afternoon sunlight. The viewpoint is elevated, offering a wide-angle perspective that captures the vastness of the ocean and the intricate details of the coastal flora. The midground is dominated by a dramatic sea arch, a natural sculpture carved by the persistent forces of nature, standing as a testament to time and erosion. Further in the distance, a cluster of seagulls hovers in the breeze, their white silhouettes stark against the deep blue sky. The lighting is warm and golden, typical of the late afternoon, casting long shadows that stretch across the rocky terrain. This creates a dynamic interplay of light and shadow, accentuating the textures and contours of the landscape. The color palette is a harmonious blend of cool ocean blues, vibrant moss greens, and the warm golden tones of the sunlit rocks, creating a mood of serenity and timeless beauty. The scene is captured in a realistic, high-definition photographic style, with meticulous attention to detail, sharpness, and clarity, embodying the essence of professional landscape photography.",
