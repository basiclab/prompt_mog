  "prompt": "Under the vast, inky expanse of a moonless night sky, an isolated wooden pier stretches out over a serene alpine lake nestled within an undisturbed valley. The pier, weathered by time and elements, acts as a contemplative vantage point from which a lone observer can embrace the celestial splendor above. This landscape is viewed from a slightly elevated angle, where the camera captures the fullness of the scene, starting from the foreground where the pier extends out towards the lake, leading the eye deeper into the composition. In the midground, the still water of the lake mirrors the starry sky, creating an illusion of continuity between earth and cosmos. Beyond the lake, silhouettes of distant mountains form a jagged horizon that blends into the sky, offering a subtle contrast against the sea of stars. The absence of artificial light sources emphasizes the clarity of the star field, where clusters of stars form the Milky Way, a river of light across the heavens. Silver starlight casts a gentle glow on the scene, creating soft reflections on the lake's surface and muted shadows along the pier. The color palette is dominated by deep blues interspersed with shimmering whites and occasional hints of faint greens from distant nebulae, evoking a mood of tranquility and introspection. The scene's artistic style is reminiscent of classic landscape photography, capturing the essence of untouched natural beauty under the night sky. The image is rendered with high resolution, ensuring every star and reflection is depicted in sharp detail, conveying the majesty of the cosmos with professional precision and finesse.",

    "Beneath the endless dark sky devoid of moonlight, a solitary wooden dock stretches over a peaceful mountain lake in an untouched valley. This time-worn pier serves as a contemplative spot for a solitary viewer to admire the stellar beauty above. The camera, from a slightly elevated angle, captures the scene fully, starting with the pier reaching out toward the lake and drawing the eye into the composition's depths. The lake's calm waters in the midground reflect the star-lit sky, blurring the line between earth and heavens. Silhouettes of faraway mountains create a rough horizon blending into the sky, contrasting subtly with the starry sea. With no man-made lights, the star field shines bright, with star clusters forming the Milky Way like a luminous river. Silver light from the stars gently bathes the scene, casting faint reflections on the lake and soft shadows on the pier. Deep blues dominate the color scheme, accented by shimmering whites and faint greens from nebulae, conveying a mood of peace and contemplation. The scene's style echoes traditional landscape photography, celebrating nature's unspoiled beauty under the starlit sky. The image is high-resolution, detailing every star and reflection with sharp precision, portraying the cosmos's grandeur with professional skill.",
    "Underneath the vast, dark moonlight-absent night sky, a lone wooden pier extends over a tranquil alpine lake set in an untouched valley. This aged pier, weathered by nature's forces, offers a meditative spot from which a solitary observer can gaze at the celestial wonders above. Viewed from a slightly upward angle, the camera captures the full scene from the foreground, with the pier leading into the lake and drawing attention deeper into the view. The lake's still waters in the midground mirror the starry sky, blurring the boundary between earth and space. In the distance, the silhouettes of mountains create a jagged horizon merging into the sky, subtly contrasting with the sea of stars. The lack of artificial light enhances the star field's clarity, as star clusters form the Milky Way, like a river of light in the sky. Silver starlight gently illuminates the scene, creating soft reflections on the lake's surface and muted pier shadows.
