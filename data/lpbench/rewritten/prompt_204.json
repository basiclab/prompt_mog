  "prompt": "As twilight descends upon the Earth, a formidable front of thunderheads looms menacingly over an abandoned rural farmhouse. These cumulonimbus giants seem to pulsate with an electric energy, their dark gray cauldrons interspersed with flickering forks of lightning that tear through the thick haze, illuminating the surrounding landscape in brief, blinding flashes. The farmhouse, timeworn and sagging, stands at the edge of a vast, windswept field strewn with wilted stalks of wild grass and forgotten farming tools, remnants of its more prosperous past. Viewed from a slightly elevated perspective, the scene captures the tumult and drama of nature's power, as if the camera is positioned on a nearby knoll. In the foreground, the rustic wooden fence lines converge towards the farmhouse, leading the eye into the heart of the storm’s ferocity. The depth of the image is palpable, with the farmhouse providing a solitary human-made counterpoint against the expansive backdrop of the churning sky. Dusk's last light casts a surreal golden hue across the scene, reflected in the few surviving windows of the farmhouse, contrasting sharply against the icy blue shadows that engulf the field. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation and the scent of ozone, suggesting the imminence of a deluge. Rich sepia and slate tones dominate the color palette, creating a mood that is both nostalgic and ominous, underscored by the stark contrast between the storm's silver linings and the pitch-black bases of the clouds. The stylistic approach draws from the dramatic realism of storm photography, capturing the intricate detail of cloud textures and lightning arcs with masterful clarity. The photograph is rendered in exquisite detail, highlighting every crack in the farmhouse’s weathered surface and every ripple in the approaching storm, demonstrating technical excellence in capturing high-resolution, dynamic weather patterns.",
