  "prompt": "Amidst a dramatic atmospheric ballet, a solitary, timeworn barn stands resiliently in a field of golden wheat, its weathered wood and sagging roof testament to years of enduring the elements. Above, a whirlwind of meteorological phenomena unfolds, as a colossal supercell storm churns the sky, its immense, swirling form dominating the heavens with a formidable presence. The scene is viewed from a slightly elevated, wide-angle perspective, capturing the expansive breadth of the landscape with an eye that pans from the rustling wheat in the foreground to the barn at mid-focus, and finally up to the tempestuous sky that envelops the horizon in shadow and light. As the late afternoon sun struggles to pierce through the thick veil of rolling clouds, a stark interplay of light and shadow ensues, casting the barn in alternating washes of warm sunlight and cold shadows. This dynamic lighting paints the scene with a palette of deep indigos and stark whites, contrasted by the earthy ochres of the field beneath, generating a mood both dramatic and foreboding with the promise of an impending storm. The swirling vortex of clouds is textured with ripples and folds, its edges tinged with a ghostly luminescence as flashes of distant lightning briefly illuminate their depths. In the distance, a solitary tree stands in defiance against the storm, its silhouette stark and gnarled, adding another layer of texture and depth to the scene. The image, rendered with a hyper-realistic style, captures every minute detail with masterful clarity, from the individual blades of wheat to the subtly gradating hues of the storm clouds, ensuring a breathtakingly vivid portrayal of nature's volatile beauty.",
