  "prompt": "In a serene and distant corner of the globe, an ancient stone lighthouse stands proudly on an isolated cliff overlooking an infinite ocean. The lighthouse, weathered by centuries of Atlantic winds and majestic sea sprays, offers a timeless reminder of humanity’s enduring desire to reach out into the cosmos. As night falls, the scene transforms under the vast, star-studded canopy of the sky, where countless celestial bodies shimmer in the crystalline clarity of the atmosphere above. A lone astronomer, clad in a sturdy jacket to fend off the ocean's chill, stands beside a sophisticated telescope, casting her gaze upward, enraptured by the celestial dance unfolding. The camera captures the scene from a slightly elevated angle, framing the lighthouse to the right with the expansive ocean unfolding to the left, and the telescope prominently in the midground. This perspective enhances the feeling of solitude and devotion, as the astronomer's silhouette is dwarfed by the vast universe overhead. The scene is bathed in the gentle, silvery glow of the moonlight mingling with the faint hues of the Milky Way, creating an ethereal ambiance that is punctuated by the occasional meteor streaking across the sky. The color palette is dominated by deep midnight blues and silvery whites, interspersed with the subtle greens and purples of the distant nebulae. This combination evokes a sense of mystery and wonder, inviting viewers to ponder the infinite possibilities of the universe. The photographic style is reminiscent of classic astrophotography, with an emphasis on long exposure, capturing sharp, detailed star trails that contrast strikingly against the dark silhouette of the cliffside. The image possesses an 8K resolution quality, ensuring every detail, from the texture of the lighthouse's stones to the astronomer's focused expression, is rendered with professional sharpness and precision.",

    "In a tranquil and remote part of the world, an ancient stone lighthouse rises majestically on a secluded cliff above an endless ocean. The lighthouse, worn by centuries of Atlantic breezes and grand sea mists, serves as an eternal symbol of humanity's quest to explore the cosmos. As dusk settles, the panorama changes beneath the vast, star-filled sky, where innumerable celestial bodies glimmer in the clear, crystal air. A solitary astronomer, dressed warmly against the ocean's chill, stands by a complex telescope, her eyes lifted to the heavens, captivated by the celestial ballet above. The scene is captured from a slightly raised angle, with the lighthouse on the right and the sweeping ocean on the left, highlighting the telescope in the midground. This viewpoint enhances the sense of solitude and dedication, as the astronomer's figure is overshadowed by the immense universe above. The scene is suffused with the gentle, silvery glow of moonlight blending with the soft hues of the Milky Way, creating a heavenly atmosphere accented by the occasional meteor streaking by. The color scheme is dominated by deep midnight blues and silvery whites, with hints of distant nebulae's greens and purples. This combination conjures a sense of mystery and awe, inviting viewers to contemplate the universe's infinite possibilities. The photographic style echoes classic astrophotography, focusing on long exposure to capture sharp, detailed star trails that sharply contrast with the dark outline of the cliff. The image boasts an 8K resolution, ensuring every detail, from the lighthouse's stone texture to the astronomer's focused look, is depicted with expert clarity and accuracy.",
