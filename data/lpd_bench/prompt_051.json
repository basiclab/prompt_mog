  "prompt": "A serene coastal landscape stretches far and wide as the sun begins its slow descent beyond the horizon, casting a golden glow across the expansive seascape. A lone wooden pier juts into the tranquil waters of the ocean, its weathered beams and planks carrying the stories of countless tides. To the left of the pier, a small sailboat drifts leisurely, its white sails catching the last warm rays of the sun. Waves lap gently against the shoreline, creating rhythmic patterns in the wet sand, while a pair of seagulls wheel gracefully overhead, their reflections shimmering on the water’s surface. The sky above is a canvas of soft pastels, with hues of orange, pink, and lavender blending seamlessly as dusk approaches. The scene is captured from a low vantage point near the shoreline, with the pier positioned slightly off-center, drawing the viewer's eye along its length towards the infinite expanse of the ocean. In the foreground, the fine grains of sand are meticulously detailed, while in the background, the horizon line stretches unbroken, amplifying the sense of endless space. This moment is wrapped in an air of tranquility, the gentle breeze whispering through the dunes, the scent of salt lingering in the air. The photograph is rendered in the style of classic landscape photography, with an emphasis on natural beauty and serene compositions. Every detail is captured in sharp clarity, from the intricate textures of the sand to the delicate ripples of the water, presenting a scene that is both visually stunning and emotionally evocative.",

    "A peaceful coastal scene unfolds as the sun sets slowly on the horizon, bathing the vast ocean in a golden light. An old wooden pier extends into the calm sea, its timeworn structure echoing stories of the tides. A small sailboat with white sails floats gently to the left of the pier, catching the day's last warm sunlight. Gentle waves caress the shore, crafting rhythmic designs in the sand, while two seagulls soar high above, their reflections shimmering on the water. The sky is painted with soft pastel colors, where orange, pink, and lavender hues merge as twilight nears. The view is from a low perspective by the shore, with the pier slightly off to the side, leading the viewer's gaze along its length to the endless ocean. Up close, the sand's fine grains are intricately detailed, and in the distance, the horizon runs unbroken, enhancing the sense of limitless space. This tranquil moment whispers with a gentle breeze through the dunes and carries the scent of the sea. The image is styled like classic landscape photography, focusing on natural beauty and serene compositions. Every detail, from the sand's textures to the water's ripples, is captured with precision, creating a scene that's both visually striking and emotionally moving.",
