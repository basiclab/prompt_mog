  "prompt": "As the vibrant hues of the setting sun paint the sky in shades of orange and pink, a dramatic seascape unfolds along a rugged coastline. Jagged cliffs rise precipitously from the ocean, casting long shadows that stretch across the waves. A solitary lighthouse stands sentinel atop one of the cliffs, its whitewashed walls bathed in the golden light, providing a stark contrast against the deep azure of the sea. The camera captures the scene from a low vantage point near the shoreline, framing the lighthouse in the upper third of the image, with the expansive ocean filling the rest of the composition. Waves crash relentlessly against the base of the cliffs, creating a dynamic interplay between land and sea. The powerful surf sends plumes of white spray into the air, glistening in the fading light. In the foreground, a narrow strip of sandy beach is strewn with smooth, time-worn pebbles that reflect the twilight glow, adding texture and detail to the scene. The warm, golden hour light enhances the natural colors, saturating the orange and pink hues in the sky while deepening the blues of the ocean. Beneath the surface, the water takes on a greenish tinge where the sun's rays penetrate, revealing the undulating patterns of the seabed. A gentle breeze stirs the coastal grass atop the cliffs, adding a sense of motion and life to the tranquil yet powerful atmosphere. Captured in high-resolution with precise detail, the composition evokes a sense of awe and contemplation, echoing the timeless connection between the forceful sea and the steadfast land, rendered in the style of fine art seascape photography.",

    "As the vibrant hues of the setting sun transform the sky into shades of orange and pink, a dramatic coastal scene unfolds along a rugged shoreline. Jagged cliffs rise sharply from the ocean, casting elongated shadows across the waves. A solitary lighthouse perches atop one of the cliffs, its whitewashed walls illuminated by golden light, contrasting with the deep blue of the sea. The camera captures this view from a low angle near the shore, placing the lighthouse in the upper third of the image, with the vast ocean filling the rest. Waves crash relentlessly at the cliff bases, creating a dynamic interplay between land and sea. The powerful surf sends plumes of white spray into the air, sparkling in the fading light. In the foreground, a narrow sandy beach is scattered with smooth, time-worn pebbles that reflect the twilight glow, adding texture and detail. The warm, golden hour light enhances the natural colors, saturating the orange and pink hues in the sky while deepening the ocean's blues. Beneath the surface, the water is tinged green where sunlight penetrates, revealing seabed patterns. A gentle breeze stirs the coastal grass atop the cliffs, adding motion and life to the powerful yet serene atmosphere. Captured in high-resolution and with precise detail, the composition evokes awe and contemplation, echoing the timeless relationship between the forceful sea and steadfast land, akin to fine art seascape photography.",
    "The setting sun's vibrant hues cast shades of orange and pink across the sky, unveiling a dramatic seascape along a rugged coastline. Jagged cliffs rise sharply from the ocean, casting long shadows over the waves.

    "With the setting sun casting vibrant orange and pink hues across the sky, a dramatic seascape unfolds along the rugged coastline. Jagged cliffs rise sharply from the ocean, casting lengthy shadows over the waves. Atop one cliff, a lone lighthouse stands, its whitewashed walls glowing with golden light against the deep azure sea. The camera captures this from a low vantage near the shore, with the lighthouse framed in the upper third, and the vast ocean filling the rest. Waves crash against the cliff bases, creating a dynamic interplay of land and sea. The powerful surf sends plumes of white spray into the air, glinting in the twilight. In the foreground, a sandy beach is scattered with smooth pebbles, reflecting the fading glow and adding texture. The warm golden hour light enhances natural colors, intensifying the sky's orange and pink while deepening the blues of the sea. Below the surface, water acquires a greenish hue where sunlight penetrates, revealing seabed patterns. Coastal grass sways gently in the breeze atop the cliffs, adding motion and life to the serene yet powerful scene. Captured in high-resolution with precise detail, this image evokes a sense of awe, echoing the timeless connection between the ocean and land, reminiscent of fine art seascape photography."
