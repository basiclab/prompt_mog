  "prompt": "In the heart of an aesthetically modern kitchen, a stunning array of culinary artistry is displayed on a luxurious, polished marble countertop. At the center of this gastronomic tableau is a beautifully plated dish of vibrant Southeast Asian cuisine, its presentation a symphony of colors and textures that invites admiration. The dish features succulent, perfectly seared scallops nestled on a bed of fragrant jasmine rice, accompanied by a delicate mango salsa and garnished with microgreens. This culinary composition is captured from a slightly elevated angle, allowing for a complete view of the plate and an appreciation of the intricate garnishing art. Surrounding the main dish are artisanal porcelain bowls containing an assortment of colorful side dishes, which include a tangy papaya salad and crisp vegetable spring rolls artfully arranged in a radial pattern. The kitchen is bathed in warm, natural sunlight streaming through large, floor-to-ceiling windows, casting soft, dappling shadows across the countertop and adding depth and contrast to the scene. The light reflects gently off the glossy surfaces, enhancing the dish's appeal and drawing out the colors' vibrancy. A palette of warm earth tones, with accents of fresh green and bright citrus hues, creates a lively yet sophisticated atmosphere that embodies both the excitement and elegance of world-class cuisine. The overall composition is captured in the style of fine art food photography, with each element meticulously in focus, ensuring that every detail—from the rice's texture to the scallops' caramelization—is crisp and inviting. This visual feast is presented with the technical precision and artistry expected of a world-renowned culinary studio, where every plate is not just a meal but an edible masterpiece.",
