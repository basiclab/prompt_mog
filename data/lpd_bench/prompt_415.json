From this elevated vantage point, the drone captures the intricate layout of the fortress: a maze of narrow passageways, courtyards, and towers. This height accentuates the grandeur of the fortress, set against the expansive backdrop of the ocean. The gentle late afternoon sunlight bathes the scene in a warm glow, casting long shadows that stretch across the courtyard stones, and creating a peaceful, contemplative atmosphere. The light highlights the texture of the ancient stones, their weathered surfaces telling tales of centuries past. A palette of warm, earthy tones blends seamlessly with the cool blues and greens of the sea and sky, evoking a sense of calm and timelessness. The image is rendered in a cinematic, high-definition style, capturing every detail with crisp clarity. The composition invites the viewer to explore the fortress's storied past, while the sweeping view of the ocean hints at distant adventures and unexplored horizons. This aerial perspective not only celebrates the fortress's enduring presence but also offers a moment to appreciate the boundless beauty and mystery of the sea beyond.",
