  "prompt": "Amidst a sprawling countryside, a lone, ancient windmill stands tall, bracing itself against the elements as a storm of epic proportions approaches. The sky above is a swirling mass of deep gray and ominous blue clouds, churning in an almost otherworldly dance of nature's power. Lightning forks violently through the storm, casting brief, stark illuminations across the landscape, like nature's flashbulbs capturing the scene in momentary brilliance. The camera captures this tempestuous scene from a mid-range distance, placing the windmill slightly off-center to the left, allowing the viewer to experience the full breadth of the storm’s ferocity. A field of golden wheat undulates in the foreground, offering a delicate counterpoint to the storm's raw might, while a distant line of shadowed trees forms a natural boundary between the earth and sky. The atmosphere is electrifying, charged with the palpable tension of impending weather, punctuated by the occasional thunderclap. This dramatic high-contrast lighting highlights the textured wood of the windmill, etched with the marks of time and weathering, while the shadows cast by the clouds create dynamic patterns that sweep over the wheat. The color palette is a complex interplay of cool, stormy blues and grays contrasted with the warm, rich hues of the earth, inducing a mood of anticipation and awe. Photographed with a style reminiscent of classic landscape photography yet embraced with a modern sense of drama, the final image is one of high detail and resolution, capturing every nuance of texture and light with professional precision. The photograph resonates with the themes of endurance and nature's unfathomable power, offering viewers a momentary glimpse into a world both familiar and formidable.",
