  "prompt": "Amidst a secluded and quiet stretch of coastal terrain, a lone, weathered lighthouse stands as a sentinel at the edge of a jagged cliff, where the earth plunges dramatically into the ocean below. The lighthouse, with its faded white exterior and red-capped roof, serves as the focal point of the scene, evoking a sense of history and resilience against the relentless forces of nature. From a high vantage point, the camera captures the lighthouse framed centrally in the composition, with the untamed sea stretching infinitely to the horizon in the background. Wisps of clouds drift lazily across the sky, their reflections dancing upon the lightly textured water surface, enhancing the scene's depth and inviting the viewer's gaze to wander across the seascape. It is late afternoon, and the setting sun casts a warm, golden glow that caresses the lighthouse’s weathered facade, creating a striking contrast against the deep cerulean blue of the ocean beneath. The light softens as it filters through the sea mist, lending an ethereal quality to the atmosphere and casting elongated shadows that play upon the rocky cliff face. The color palette is a harmonious blend of warm ochres and burnt siennas with cool ocean blues and gentle sky pastels, creating a serene and contemplative mood that speaks to the timeless dance between land and sea. The photographic style is reminiscent of classic fine art photography, emphasizing texture, light, and shadow to produce a richly detailed image that captures the viewer's imagination. Captured with professional-grade equipment, the image is crisp, clear, and meticulously composed, showcasing high resolution and exquisite detail, ensuring every nuance of the scene is preserved with breathtaking clarity.",
