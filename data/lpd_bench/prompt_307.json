  "prompt": "In the heart of a sprawling metropolis lies a contemporary museum that stands as a testament to modern architectural ingenuity. This striking structure is characterized by its bold, angular forms and sweeping curves, a harmonious blend of glass, steel, and exposed concrete. Positioned on the bustling waterfront, the museum's facade reflects the shimmering play of sunlight on water, creating a dynamic interplay of shadows and light. The camera captures this architectural marvel from a raised platform across the canal, offering a panoramic view that encompasses both the building and its vibrant urban surroundings. In the foreground, the calm waters of the canal mirror the museum's silhouette, adding to the composition's symmetry, while in the background, the city skyline with its eclectic mix of historical and modern architecture frames the scene. Late afternoon sunlight bathes the museum in a warm, golden hue, accentuating the textures of the glass panels and casting long shadows that enhance its geometric precision. The color palette is a sophisticated blend of cool blues and grays contrasted with warm amber tones, evoking a mood of forward-thinking elegance. Inside the museum, the gentle hum of activity is suggested through the glimpses of visitors and exhibition lights visible through the expansive glass walls. Captured in the style of fine art architectural photography, the image combines high-resolution sharpness with a masterful control of composition, embodying both the essence of the museum and the story of the city it inhabits.",
