  "prompt": "In a surreal dreamscape that stretches infinitely in all directions, a colossal mechanical phoenix takes flight above an endless ocean made of glistening mercury-like liquid. The phoenix, constructed from intricately interlocking golden gears and vibrant red metal feathers, glows with an internal, pulsing light that casts a warm, ethereal luminescence. Seen from a bird’s-eye view, the mechanical marvel is positioned slightly off-center in the frame, its outstretched wings creating an expansive diagonal that guides the viewer's gaze across the scene. Below, the liquid ocean is a smooth, reflective surface, capturing the phoenix's fiery glow and mirroring the swirling patterns of a psychedelic sky filled with swirling ribbons of pink, violet, and turquoise. The atmosphere is thick with an otherworldly haze that softens the horizon line, while the sky above is a tempest of shifting colors reminiscent of an aurora borealis at its zenith. The play of light lends a sense of fluidity, with the mercury surface rippling gently as though breathing in tandem with the sky. The scene's color palette is dominated by warm golds and fiery reds, contrasted with cool blues and purples that suggest a dynamic interplay between creation and chaos. An air of timeless wonder pervades, as particles of stardust shimmer in the breeze, creating a celestial bridge linking earth and sky. The overall style is a harmonious blend of high-resolution photorealism and imaginative fantasy, captured with the meticulous detail of a master craftsman. Every feather on the phoenix is razor-sharp, every ripple on the mercury ocean rendered with precision. This image speaks to both the meticulous craftsmanship of steampunk artistry and the limitless, often paradoxical wonders of the imagination.",
