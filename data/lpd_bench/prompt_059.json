  "prompt": "On the rugged coast of a secluded bay, a solitary shipwreck rests, half-submerged and battered by the relentless waves. The air is filled with the pungent scent of salt and the distant cry of seabirds echoing off the cliffs. This forgotten relic, a large wooden ship, stands as a testament to time, its hull split and sails tattered, as the ocean appears to reclaim its once-proud structure. In the foreground, barnacle-covered rocks jut out, surrounded by tide pools bustling with marine life, where tiny crabs scuttle and colorful sea anemones sway gently with the current. The scene is viewed from a high vantage point, offering a grand panorama that captures the shipwreck near the center, with cliffs framing the composition on either side. The foreground rocks transition smoothly into the midground of the crashing surf, while the distant horizon blends seamlessly into the vast expanse of the sea and sky. The light of an overcast afternoon casts a diffused glow across the scene, softening the harshness of the jagged rocks and muted colors of the ship. The steel gray of the waves contrasts with the occasional glint of silver as the water catches what little sunlight penetrates the cloud cover. There's an ethereal quality to the scene, enhanced by the gentle mist rising off the sea, imparting a ghostly aura to the shipwreck. The color palette leans towards cool tones, with predominantly grays and blues that evoke a sense of melancholy serenity. This atmospheric image captures the essence of seascape photography, blending the tangible textures of weathered wood and stone with the fluid movement of the ocean in a cohesive, high-resolution composition that highlights the intricate details of each element.",

The salty air is alive with the distant calls of seabirds reverberating off the cliffs. This old wooden vessel, now a forgotten artifact, stands as a testament to time, with a split hull and tattered sails, as if the ocean is repossessing what was once majestic. Barnacle-crusted rocks jut out in the foreground, surrounded by bustling tide pools filled with marine life, including scampering tiny crabs and vibrant sea anemones gently swaying with the tide. Observed from a high vantage point, the scene encompasses a grand panorama with the shipwreck at the center, framed by cliffs on each side. The rocks in the foreground gradually lead into the crashing waves midground, while the horizon seamlessly merges into the endless sea and sky beyond. An overcast afternoon light casts a soft glow across the scene, tempering the sharp jagged rocks and the muted tones of the ship. The steel-gray waves contrast subtly with silver glints as sparse sunlight filters through the clouds. The scene exudes an ethereal quality, with mist rising from the sea, imparting a spectral aura to the shipwreck. The color scheme leans towards cool shades, predominantly grays and blues, evoking a melancholic tranquility.
