  "prompt": "An elegant wedding ceremony unfurls in an ornate, historical villa set against the backdrop of the serene Tuscan countryside. The villa’s grand courtyard, with its classical archways and intricately carved stone statues, provides a stunning backdrop for the celebration. A white silk canopy, adorned with delicate strands of blossoming wisteria, gracefully shelters guests seated in neat rows of white wooden chairs, their surfaces gleaming under the afternoon sun. The bride, dressed in an exquisite ivory lace gown, stands poised at the end of a petal-strewn aisle, her bouquet a vibrant mix of peonies and roses. The groom, in a tailored navy suit, awaits her with an expression of joy and anticipation. Captured from an elevated vantage point, the scene unfolds like a timeless painting, the camera lens lovingly focusing on each detail—the flowing gown, the floral arrangements, and the joyful faces captured mid-laughter and excitement. Sunlight filters through the open canopy, casting soft, dappled patterns on the courtyard floor, while a gentle breeze stirs the flowers in bloom. The light bathes the entire scene in a warm, golden hue, enhancing the vibrant colors of the floral arrangements and the rich textures of the villa’s stone facade. The mood is a blend of romantic and celebratory, as classical string music gently fills the air, creating an atmosphere of timeless elegance and joy. Rendered in the style of fine art photography, with exceptional attention to detail and clarity, the image captures the essence of a moment filled with love and promise, immortalized in high-resolution brilliance that allows every nuance to be savored. The result is a masterful composition that celebrates both the grandeur of the setting and the intimacy of the occasion.",
