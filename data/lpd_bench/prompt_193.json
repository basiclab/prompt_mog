  "prompt": "In the stillness of a secluded coastal region, a solitary rock formation rises from the dark, undulating waves of the ocean, crowned with a hardy, ancient pine tree clinging stubbornly to life. Above, the night sky unfurls an awe-inspiring panorama of celestial phenomena. The scene is captured from a vantage point on a nearby cliff, offering a sweeping view that places the rugged rock formation prominently in the foreground. The sky is alive with a dazzling display of stars, interrupted by the ghostly glow of the Milky Way arching magnificently across the heavens. The photographer positions the camera at a low angle, emphasizing the grandeur of the sky as it stretches infinitely beyond the horizon, while the rocky outcrop provides an earthy anchor to the scene. Luminous streaks from meteors flash momentarily amidst the constellations, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil tableau. The ocean, reflecting the celestial lights above, is a silvery expanse, its surface lightly rippled by the whispering night breezes. A cool, bluish hue suffuses the entire scene, with the subtle contrast of warmer star colors adding depth and texture. The atmosphere is crisp and clear, free from the interference of city lights, allowing the night sky to reveal its intricate tapestry in remarkable detail. The composition is evocative of a dreamlike, almost surreal quality, reminiscent of a timeless night where nature's ancient rhythms continue undisturbed. Captured with expert precision, the image boasts sharp detail and a rich tapestry of textures, delivering an immersive experience that invites the viewer to linger beneath the infinite cosmos.",
