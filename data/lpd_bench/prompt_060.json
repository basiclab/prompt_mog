  "prompt": "The horizon stretches infinitely beyond the frame as the ocean holds its breath under the weight of the sky. In this expanse of nature’s canvas, a weathered lighthouse stands as the solitary sentinel on a jagged cliff's edge, its paint peeling from years of salt-laden winds. The lighthouse, juxtaposed against the vastness of the ocean, directs its gaze toward the tumultuous waves crashing against the rocks below. Captured from an elevated perspective, the scene unfolds with the lighthouse slightly off-center, enhancing the grandeur of the surrounding seascape. In the foreground, the cliff's rugged texture and patches of wild grass frame the view, while distant sailboats speckle the horizon, drawing the eye further into the depth of the scene. As the sun descends, a gentle breeze carries the scent of salt and the cry of distant seabirds. The fading light paints the sky in a breathtaking symphony of deep oranges, fiery reds, and subtle purples, casting long shadows that dance across the surface of the water. The white crests of the waves catch the sunlight, momentarily flickering with hints of gold before disappearing into the sea’s depth. The mood is reflective, a quiet surrender to the immense beauty and solitude of the coastal environment. The photograph employs a fine art seascape style, capturing the serene yet powerful narrative of nature. With high-definition clarity, the image boasts intricate details and textures, from the grains of sand clinging to the rocks to the delicate play of light on water, all meticulously rendered to evoke a sense of awe and reverence for the natural world.",

    "The infinite horizon stretches far beyond the image's frame as the ocean silently waits under the sky's weight. On this canvas of nature, a weathered lighthouse stands alone on the edge of a jagged cliff, its paint chipped by years of salty winds. Set against the vast ocean, the lighthouse looks towards the wild waves crashing on the rocks below. Captured from above, the scene features the lighthouse slightly off-center, accentuating the seascape's grandeur. In the foreground, the cliff's rough surface and wild grasses frame the view, while distant sailboats dot the horizon, inviting the eye deeper into the scene. As the sun sets, a soft breeze brings the salty scent and distant seabird calls. The dimming light paints the sky in rich oranges, reds, and purples, casting long shadows that dance on the water. Wave crests catch the sunlight, shimmering gold before vanishing into the sea. The mood is contemplative, surrendering to the beauty and solitude of the coast. This fine art seascape photo captures nature's serene yet powerful story. With high-definition clarity, it displays intricate details and textures, from sand grains on the rocks to light play on water, evoking awe and reverence for nature.",
