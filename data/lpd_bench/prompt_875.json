  "prompt": "Amidst the silent, historic charm of a forgotten railway station, a solitary steam locomotive rests upon disused tracks. Its massive, iron frame is cloaked in a tapestry of rust and dust, yet retains a regal dignity from another era. Thick plumes of vapor hang motionless in the cold, crisp morning air, a sharp contrast to the station's grand, arching roof, now overgrown with creeping ivy that clings desperately to the remnants of stone-clad walls. The soft glow of dawn filters through fragmented glass panels in the ceiling, casting a delicate lace of shadows and highlights across the scene below. A cluster of scattered baggage, abandoned long ago, and a solitary wooden bench, weathered by time, frame the midground, accentuating the locomotive as the centerpiece. The composition is captured in a wide shot from a low angle, emphasizing the locomotive's towering presence as it looms over the deserted platform. Darkness gradually gives way to light as early morning fog melds with the engine's vapor to create an ethereal atmosphere. The monochrome palette of the photograph heightens the scene's nostalgic and melancholic mood, where shades of charcoal and silver interact harmoniously to evoke a sense of timeless tranquility. The image, rich in texture and laden with historical echoes, is reminiscent of classic fine art photography, with exquisite detail in every rivet and bolt of the locomotive. The photograph's sharp focus and high resolution capture the interplay of light and shadow with masterful precision, inviting the viewer to linger over each intricate detail, as if unearthing forgotten stories from the past.",

    "In the hushed, historic aura of an abandoned railway station, a lone steam locomotive sits on unused tracks. Its imposing iron structure, draped in layers of rust and dust, still exudes an air of regal dignity from a bygone era. Immobile plumes of steam linger in the crisp morning air, contrasting sharply with the station's grand, ivy-covered roof, clinging to the dilapidated stone walls.
