  "prompt": "Amidst the vast expanse of the ocean, a tranquil seascape unfolds under the gentle embrace of an overcast sky. At the center of the scene, an old, weather-beaten fishing boat drifts lazily on the calm waters, its faded paint telling tales of countless voyages and the relentless march of time. To the left, a flock of seagulls hovers gracefully above the waves, their wings catching the soft breeze as they search for a meal, casting fleeting shadows on the water below. In the background, a distant lighthouse stands sentinel on a rocky promontory, its guiding light a subtle beacon against the muted morning light. Viewed from a high vantage point, the scene captures the gentle curve of a crescent beach in the bottom right of the frame, where the shoreline is sprinkled with smooth pebbles and the occasional weathered driftwood log. The overcast sky blankets the scene in a diffused light, softening shadows and lending a subdued, almost melancholic atmosphere to the coastal tableau. The color palette is dominated by muted blues and grays, punctuated by the occasional flash of white from the seagulls and the foam-tipped waves. This somber palette evokes a sense of quiet reflection, inviting viewers to contemplate the vastness of the sea and the solitude of the fisherman’s life. The scene is captured with a documentary approach, emphasizing the natural beauty and ruggedness of the marine environment with crisp, precise details that reveal every texture of weathered wood, feather, and rock. The professional quality of the photograph is evident in its sharp focus and balanced composition, expertly rendering each element with clarity and depth, making it an evocative study of life at the edge of the sea.",

    "An expansive ocean scene unfolds under a gently clouded sky, revealing a serene seascape. Centered within the view, an old, timeworn fishing boat slowly drifts on the calm waters, its faded paint hinting at numerous journeys and the unyielding passage of years. To the left, a graceful flock of seagulls hovers above the waves, catching the breeze as they search for food, their shadows dancing on the water. A distant lighthouse in the background stands on a rocky outcrop, its light subtle against the subdued morning. The view from above includes a crescent-shaped beach in the bottom right, with its shore decorated by smooth pebbles and stray driftwood. The overcast sky envelops the scene in diffuse light, softening shadows and lending a melancholic tone to the coast.
