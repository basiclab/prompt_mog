  "prompt": "In the heart of a bustling, neon-lit city, the streets come alive through the art of long exposure photography. A historic tram, vibrant in red and gold, glides smoothly along its tracks, leaving a luminous trail of light that winds sinuously through the scene. Towering skyscrapers, their windows aglow with countless dynamic patterns, rise majestically on either side of the tram's path, framing the main subject with a sense of urban grandeur. The scene is viewed from a slightly elevated perspective, ensuring a clear view of the city's intricate layout, where the tram's light trails create an energetic zigzag pattern that guides the viewer's eyes from the foreground, through the bustling street in the midground, and into the luminous tapestry of the cityscape in the background. The entire scene is bathed in the cool, bluish hue of the late evening, interspersed with vibrant splashes of neon green and electric pink from the towering advertising screens that blanket the buildings, creating a mood of lively urban excitement. The reflective surfaces of sleek modern buildings catch the iridescent lights, casting dynamic reflections across the wet pavement, adding an additional layer of motion and complexity. The photographic style integrates techniques of fine art urban photography, capturing the frenetic energy of city life as it contrasts with the tranquility of the still buildings. With an 8K resolution, every detail is meticulously rendered, from the vivid light trails to the intricate architectural details of the skyscrapers, culminating in a masterful professional composition that captivates the viewer's senses with its blend of motion, light, and architectural beauty.",
