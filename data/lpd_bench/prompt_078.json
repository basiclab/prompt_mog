  "prompt": "As the sun ascends in the early morning sky, a remote coastal sanctuary unfurls in a breathtaking expanse, enveloped in a gentle, salty breeze. A solitary, weathered lighthouse stands resolute on a rocky promontory, its stoic silhouette outlined against the pale blush of dawn. Nearby, a pair of seabirds swoop and dive playfully, their movements gracefully echoing the rhythmic rise and fall of the ocean waves that crash against the rugged cliffs. The photographer captures this scene from a mid-level vantage point, aligning the lighthouse slightly off-center to the left, creating a dynamic balance with the vast, open sea that stretches endlessly to the right. In the foreground, smooth pebbles interspersed with clusters of seaweed form a natural border, leading the eye toward the midground, where the turbulent waters churn in frothy white crests. Beyond, the distant horizon blurs subtly against the sky, amplifying the sense of infinite openness. Bathed in the soft, diffused light of early dawn, the panorama is infused with a serene yet dynamic quality, as gentle shafts of sunlight filter through a thin veil of morning mist. This interplay of light casts delicate, elongated shadows that dance across the coastline, accentuating the textures of the rocky crags and enhancing the vividness of the scene. The color palette is a harmonious blend of soft, muted blues and grays, punctuated by the warm, subtle pinks and oranges of the early morning sky, creating an atmosphere of quiet contemplation and awe-inspiring beauty. The photographic style captures a fine art aesthetic, with an emphasis on detail and composition, ensuring every element—from the swirling sea foam to the lighthouse's ancient stone—contributes to the overall narrative. Taken with a high-resolution camera, the image boasts exceptional clarity and crispness, preserving the intricate details of the natural seascape in stunning fidelity.",
