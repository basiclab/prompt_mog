  "prompt": "In the heart of a dramatic meteorological spectacle, a monumental thunderstorm unfolds over an expansive prairie, where nature's raw power takes center stage. The scene captures a vast, flat landscape with a lonely barn standing defiantly against the storm's ferocity. This solitary structure, weathered and ancient, is positioned slightly off-center to the right of the frame, its wooden panels creaking under the relentless wind. Towering cumulonimbus clouds gather at the left, their anvil tops reaching high into the stratosphere, seemingly wrestling with the heavens themselves. The viewer's perspective is from a low angle, placing the sky in dominant position, encompassing two-thirds of the composition. From the vantage point, the eye is drawn from the rolling grasslands in the foreground to the midground barn and finally to the imposing storm clouds in the background, illustrating the sheer scale and depth of this atmospheric drama. The lighting is a tumultuous interplay of dark shadows and sudden flashes of lightning that momentarily illuminate the landscape, revealing the swirling chaos of the storm. This chiaroscuro effect adds an intense, almost theatrical quality to the scene. The color palette is dominated by cool grays and deep blues, punctuated by the brilliant white and violet of lightning flashes, creating a mood of suspense and awe. Raindrops begin to fall, adding a layer of texture and movement to the image, as if nature itself is painting with water on a vast canvas. Captured in a documentary style, the photograph evokes the raw, unfiltered power of nature, showing both the beauty and the fury of the storm, rendered in sharp, high-definition detail that emphasizes the fine textures of the clouds and the rough-hewn wood of the barn.",
